That atmosphere is comfortable and feels like your in someones garden patio dining area.  Services is good and very friendly.

342102,1,3,"Hubby and I just decided to eat out on the spur of the moment.  We’ve been here many times and their pizza is the best in the Bay Area!!   Tonight, I shared a fried calamari appetizer.  Lots of tentacles on the plate which he eats and I had a few rings.  They were in huge pieces which is different but very tasty.  My entree was the appetizer of clams.  Looked small but there were lots of clams in the bowl.  The sauce was to die for!!  My hubby had the eggplant parm.  Came with veggies and spaghetti.  Very large serving.  Eggplant was a bit too coated for him but still good.   If I were rating the pizza, I would give it a 6 out of 5 but average for these dishes tonight was average.   Waitress and servers were fabulous!","Spur of the moment",719,"Palo Alto, California",22jul2019,31jul2019

I ordered the clam appetizer which was very flavorful. The fresh salmon Florentine looked scrumptious and was entirely eaten at the table. The veal parm was also a hit with family members. Hubby and I shared the lasagna(the smallest entree of the three but good), Garlic bread served on the side was tasty. Good wine selection.","Last night with family-great retaurant!",185,"New York",06jul2019,31jul2019
342102,3,3,"Went for a Cousins birthday (his 57th) and our party easily took up 2 tables.  Approx. 4 generations altogether.  We had several starters (Salad, Bread, Calamari) .  The Claimari was pretty good, the batter was crispy and the meat still tender.  Although an Italian eatery, I still stuck to my luncheon go to whenever I try a new Restaurant: Bacon Cheeseburger and fries. Before I get to my review of my dish I want to point out.

- My aunt had the meatball Sandwich.  The portions were Huge! She could only finish about 1/3rd of the plate. She said it was really good.

- Mom had the lasagna: also a big portion and she did complain about not getting more bread but had no complaints about the main dish. 

- My uncle had the Fettuccine Carbonara.  He pretty much finished this plate and had nothign but good comments.

The ""Kids Table"":  the pizzas looked filling and everyone in that table seems to have had a good time with thier food.

My dish: Well the burger was on the smaller side.  The basic shoestring fries were just that. Stringy and basic.  It also barely seemed to be 1/2 portion as the otherwise seemingly overflowing plates of my family, mine looked...lacking.  The burger tasted like a large meatball (but still considerably smaller than my aunts meatball sandwich).
I managed to finish my plate in about 1/2 of the tiem as my family and one of my cousins order a 2 nd plate of calamari and pretty much left it for me. 

It seemed as if the chief thought the burger was for a kid and treated it as such.  But he cost was full price ($15 - $16).

Last time we visited FJ&LT the service was horrendous. We waited 45 minutes for our dishes to arrive. They kept giving us lame excuses like, ""we have lots of to-go orders"" and such, but the restaurant was far from full at the time. After complaining to the manager, our food finally came.

There seemed to be too few servers, food came out uneven, one dish was served that didn’t belong in our group ( cheese ravioli).    We didn’t know how many each dish was supposed to cover.

& I was coming from RWC, so figured to at least try this place. My friend had eaten here and said it was good. I arrived early enough which I was happy about because it got packed after we had arrived. I love the Italian decor & the staff was nice and attentive even when there were many people.

The menu has changed-again-eliminating all the dishes we would order. Osso buco, wedge salad, to name two. They used to have a nightly special that was terrific. Best chicken ever, on Wednesdays. That's gone. Now they have pizza with thick, chewy crust and ordinary pasta dishes only. My one star is generous.","This place is in trouble",1,"",27apr2019,30apr2019
342102,9,5,"Loved everything about our visit.  Staff was conscientious and observant.  Veal Marsala wasn't the best I've ever had but far, far from the worst.  Amazed at how good our pre-dinner cocktails came out.  It's hard to find a bar tender under 30 years old that can make a good Grasshopper.  My vodka martini was perfect as per my requests to prepare it.  Just what we would expect in an old school Italian restaurant.

I noted some reviews criticizing this establishment as being a parody of an Italian restaurant.  I am not sure why this should be a criticism.  It’s the same as somebody saying they would have enjoyed visiting Disneyland except that the presence of Mickey Mouse was too over-literal and on-the-nose.  For us, we loved Frankie Johnnie & Luigi Too for what it is.  We were looking for the  Italian restaurant experience and we found exactly what we were looking for.

FYI, if we need to validate our aptness to critique, we have lived and traveled extensively in Europe and spent considerable time in New York.  We have established a pretty broad exposure to Italian cuisine that is our baseline for this review.","Delightful and Relaxed... Pure Enjoyment",22,"Temecula, California",24apr2019,30apr2019

Loved this restaurant more when they had a location closer to where I live.

342108,1,1,"Fuimos a cenar en pareja con altas expectativas puesto que estamos ante un restaurante con estrella Michelin, nos habían hablado bien del sitio y las opiniones que habíamos leído no parecían malas... Sin embargo fue una decepción total. Comida carísima, platos escasos e insípidos y una selección de vinos a cual peor (al menos la que te ofrecen por maridar el menú).

Cuando vas dispuesto a pagar tanto dinero por comer bien, te esperas salir de la cena habiendo disfrutando de una experiencia gastronómica única. Nada más lejos de la realidad que te encuentras en este restaurante. Nos sentimos timados, literalmente. 

No pongo en duda la calidad de los productos, pero de verdad que los platos que nos pusieron fueron un chasco total, sin gracia, sin sabor... y casi hay que dar las gracias de que las raciones fuesen pequeñas porque no sé si habríamos podido terminar unos platos tan malos de tamaño normal. No se salvó ninguno, ni tan siquiera el postre.

En cualquier otro restaurante de Mountain View se come mucho mejor. Me parece abusivo el precio por persona del menú (mas de 400$) y de verdad que siento ser tan dura, pero hubiese agradecido mucho leer algo así antes de gastarme tanto dinero en un sitio que no merece la pena.","Timo en Mountain View.

342108,3,4,"This was my first Michelin Star restaurant and overall I had a pretty good time!  

Location:  It's actually in downtown Mountain View next to one of my favorite casual Ramen spots (Ryowa) and Verde Tea Cafe.  I've gone here so many times and did not even notice this place!  It's a 19th century house that is converted into a restaurant.  Street parking only and there was free Valet parking in an adjacent lot that was being tested by the city so I don't know how long it will be free.  I came on a Saturday at 6:00pm and didn't have trouble finding parking but I think it would be harder if you came later.

Ambiance:  The restaurant is in a converted house.  It's nice/clean inside but I didn't get a ""Wow"" factor from other expensive restaurants I've been to so that was a downside.  If you like eating in an old school house, this might be the place for you.  We ate towards the front of the restaurant with views of the sidewalk.  The room itself was kind of small my opinion.

Food:  It was a 9-10 course menu (how did other reviewers get up to 16?).  They don't tell you what the menu is up front so you can enjoy each dish as a ""surprise"" when it comes.  You'll get the full menu at the end of the meal so you can remember what you ate. They do check if you have any allergies or preferences before they serve the dishes which is good as my girlfriend did not want any cilantro in her dishes.   There is also add ons you can do: (1) Wagyu Beef + $120 each, (2) Truffle +$45 each.  Those are the ones I remember but there might be one more.  I opted for the Truffle option and I'm glad I did because I never had fresh truffle shaven over pasta before and it was a unique experience.  The meal takes 3hrs+ so be prepared for a LONG dinner.  This might be one of the longest dinners I've been to so just keep that in mind.

Other than that, the food is pretty good.  Everything tasted pretty organic and a lot of the ingredients came from their own garden that you can take a tour of if you want to.  Highlights of the meal were the hand-made sourdough bread with garlic and flower shaped butter,  Lamb/Lobster main course, and the John Dory with Sea Urchin fish course.  The portion sizes for me were a bit small for me (6ft 200 lbs) but it was fine for my girlfriend.

Service: Big shoutout to our main sever as well as all the helpers who filled the water and cleared the plates.  Impeccable service and what I expect from a Michelin Star restaurant.

In summary, this was a great first Michelin Star experience but I'm knocking off one-star since the decor/style of the restaurant isn't really my style. Everything else is spot on though.   Happy Food-ing!","First Michelin Star Experience!",9,"Fremont, California",25mar2019,31mar2019
342108,4,4,"I was pleasantly surprised during my visit to Chez TJ and came back wondering - why only one Michelin star?

The place is perfect for a romantic dinner although the price point with wine makes it a special occasion destination for most.  The courses and food are plentiful and I felt I could not eat anymore.  There were additional entrees featuring truffles - I’m not sure how I would have managed to eat any more.

The wine pairings were appropriate and well explained - although I’m not a white wine fan.

The service was very good and attentive.  While not the Three Michelin Star kind, I still wondered why this restaurant was not deserving of at least two.

All in all, a great place to go.  I’d give 4.5 stars if I could.","Very good food, attentive service",16,"Redwood City, California",23jan2019,31jan2019

Let me make this simple, they don't know how to make soup. It was colored water with very little won tons or for that matter anything else. Do yourself a favor just skip the soup 2) Singapore black pepper chicken was good but the quantity was so little, It comes with brown rice and 3) Signature Lo mein, which tasted good and the quantity was good. Most dishes were fairly mild and if you needed it spicy you have to let them know.

342109,3,1,"This is a place lacking in ability to handle food allergies so I suggest completely avoiding coming here if you have food allergies. The gluten free options are limited and they soak all the meat in eggs and put oyster sauce in all their sauces. If you ask them to prepare a dish without gluten and shellfish be prepared to have the waiter come and return three times with contrasting information and then speak with two managers and then have them put a plate with chicken fried in potato starch with nothing else (no salt, pepper, etc) on a plate and place it in front of you. I told the manager that I would not serve that to my dog. They finally did find some gluten free soy sauce and fried the chicken in it with vegetables but only after every single other person was done with their meal. No one removed dirty dishes. No one came with the check. I finally asked the hostess for the check. They did not remove that meal as they certainly should have. Horrid management. Awful.

342109,5,2,"Have been to PFC @ Stanford and it is better than this Sunnyvale location.  At both places the food is very good to exquisite.  We love the filet mignon stir fry, sesame chicken, and fried rice.

With reference to this Sunnyvale location::

1.  There's no sound-proofing.  The ceiling is reflective, hence it is noisy everywhere inside the dining room.
2.  The speakers and equalization is very poor.  The sound is flat and muffled and too loud.  The ""music"" was not consistent with the cuisine, and it was too difficult to converse among ourselves.
3.  If you go to the patio tables, there's a 60 cycle hum from the coiled heaters above, and
4.  The hard bench seats outside are uncomfortable.  There's no back support because the hard backs are at too great of an angle.  So plan on leaning forward on this hard bench, and... 
5.  The lighting on the patio is poor at night.
6.  They gave us only one empty plate each, and it was way too small.... about 6"" x 8"".    

The food is excellent and the staff so pleasant, but unless and until these six points are improved, we do not plan on returning to this location.","Delicious food, but not a good environment:  Noisy, poor muffled music, uncomfortable seats, etc.",22,"Mountain View, California",01apr2019,31mar2019

My wine arrived quickly, along with some bread and olive oil.  Soon after, my ravioli arrived.  The ravioli was nothing special, and there was A LOT of it.  As soon as I saw the portion, I knew I'd need a ""carryout box"".  I wondered where my salad was, but didn't see the waitress for awhile.  When she came back, she asked if ""we"" wanted anything else (a pet peeve- to say ""we"" when one clearly means ""you"").  She also asked if I was ""done working on the ravioli"".  I was going to tell her she forgot to bring the hammer and chisel for the ""work"", but decided against it.  When I told her I was done, she left and brought the bill.  As you can guess, the bill included the salad.  Upon my pointing that out, she said' Well, I can still bring it to you if you'd like it now"".  I replied ""Are you serious?  No thank you"".  
So, to me, the service was terrible and the food was just average.  I am wondering if people rave about this place because of the huge portions.  I am unimpressed with mass quantity.  I like some quality thrown in there as well.

It consisted of a pile of lettuce, a few small slices of avocado topped with slices of beef. Verdi burrito was a mix. The pork was nice and lean but the verdi sauce was a bit light on flavor.

I was intrigued by both the Grandma's special and the mole sauce, and asked the waiter which he recommended.  He said that they were both good, and offered to give me a half and half arrangement on my order. I had chicken enchiladas, each half covered with a different sauce.  Both were good, and different than I had encountered before.  While the Grandma's special seemed rather mild at first bite, it was very tasty.  The mole had a lighter flavor than I am used to, but again, it was delicious.  

My dining partner had a chili verde burrito, and told me that it was excellent, but unfortunately did not offer to share.

(coconut-crusted snapper)  if they had been open on sunday, i might have gone back just to order that curry.  the good--they have a non-alcoholic mojito on the menu--the bad--they don't put a stick of cane sugar in it.  ah well, still refreshing.  the restaurant noise level is just short of impossible to hear--let's say it's lively rather than noisy.  prices are high, water is wet--this is palo alto.","not 100% authentic but good food",105,"Chicago, Illinois",21aug2019,31aug2019

Granted that the atmosphere is lively, but in the same way that many Tex-Mex restaurants are:  ""shove 'em in and move 'em out"" should be their motto.  Every item we ordered came out suspiciously fast (were they pre-cooked and sitting in the warmer?).  Drinks were undersized, and the food was tasty but heavy and VERY caloric.  We ordered the snapper for something on the light side, but were dismayed by the deep-fried pieces that arrived (in three minutes), which reportedly had some small pieces of white fish lying somewhere in the middle.","A Restaurant that Falls Short",48,"Palo Alto, California",24feb2019,28feb2019

The service is super friendly and the staff is ready to serve with a smile.
Enter from the front or the rear entrance. If you come in the back door, you'll go through the outside patio and cigar lounge. After or before your meal you can have a drink here (but you have to bring it out yourself from the bar). 
There is also outdoor seating in front. They offer heaters and lap blankets for chillier nights. 
My favorite is the Ajiaco dish for two. You can order it for 3 and it's still a good-sized meal. The sauce is so tasty. 
Price-wise, it's not cheap, but not overly expensive either. It's a pretty standard price-point for Palo Alto restaurants. So far, I've not had a bad meal here yet.","Love this spot",103,"Palo Alto, California",12feb2019,28feb2019

357295,0,1,"We have been going to this restaurant for over 20 years, even when it was Bandera's.  We have always enjoyed the food, customer service, the wait staff and the atmosphere.  

But since 2018, something in this place has changed, and not for the better.  The last 5-6 visits, we have had a negative experiences.

The first ones were our take out orders.  One order we got home and we were missing a whole entree.  I went back to get (10 minute drive each way) and told the person who does take outs, all they said was they were sorry, and I had to wait 15 minutes, and I was not offered a refund or anything.  Our next take out order, I'd ordered a whole chicken along with other entrees, and was going to cut up to make my child a quesadilla.  Id asked the server if I could get 2 tortillas, Id pay for them too, I wasnt expecting free, and she said she couldnt give me any, that they were needed for their chips and enchiladas and they were limited, and she was condescending to add.  Really, for as much as I am paying for 3 entrees (almost $100) you cant give me 2 stupid tortillas???  I then talked to the manager, I just said that this was dissapointing, and all he said was ""yeah, sorry""

Wow

Our next take out, I tried calling twice and got ""Los Altos Grill, please hold"" then waited 5 minutes EACH time.  So I drove down figuring Id save time and find out that they are not doing to go orders on weekends anymore!!!!  

Wow

Back in february I took 3 friends here.  We checked in and the hostess said itd be 15-20 minutes.  No problem we went to the bar and ordered a drink.  I distinctly remember the 2 couples that came in behind us cause I jokingly thought to myself how nice it must be to be rich dudes in your 60's dating very pretty late 20 somethings.  while at bar I looked over and saw them getting seated.  I went to the hostess and said those people came in after us.  She said she called my name but we didnt reply!  What??  we were literally 5 feet away at the corner of the bar from the hostess area.  This was discrimination for prioritizing rich people over average local yocals.  She said she'd sit us next....and it was another 20 minute wait.  Then on top of all this, though our waitress did a fine job, a couple of our entrees were luke warm when delivered, and we never got our cornbread.

then this last time, just my wife and I went. While waiting one of the hosts walks up to me and says ""sorry we ask gentlemen to remove their hats"".  okay, Ive worn one before but I politely took off.  Then after dinner as we walking out, there are 4 men, dressed like they just played golf, all wearing their hats.  

Wow.

I dont know if its cause Los Altos is so Googled out, so much money, but the atmosphere has gotten snobby.  I have gotten poor customer service, and bad experiences.  I can get once in awhile things may not go well, but when its consecutive, its a pattern.  And when the pattern is going downhill, I got to call it as it is, and this restaurant is either only worried about their uber rich clientle, or its management has turned over and are not the same folks that cared about ALL customers.  case in point, about 8-9 years ago we had dinner there, and they have live plants on the walls and act as a divider between booths, well we had all these little gnats flying around and landing on our food.  We told the manager, who first moved us immediately, redelivered fresh entrees, comped our meal and gave us a $100 gift card.  That was almost too much we thought, but that was a reason why we liked this place so much, and ordered in or out at least once a month.  Heck, now I couldnt even get 2 tortillas.

Sorry LAG, but you lost a regular, and I will be telling other los altos locals (who are not uber rich) about how you have gone down hill.","Used to be better, but has gone downhill",71,"San Jose, California",07sep2019,30sep2019

357295,11,5,"I am happy to report that a quality beef choice has returned to the Los Altos Grill’s menu, which had lagged of late.  A good ribeye steak is back on the regular menu.

The Grill has always had a small, tight menu, where they focus on doing a few items really well.  This approach has served them well for decades, and we’ve been happy with it.  But for a time, there was literally no high-end beef choices on the regular menu.  They maintained their steak and enchilada dish and a few other low-end beef choices, and their signature ribs and chicken dishes had stayed on the menu as well.  But the prime rib and all the high-end steak dishes disappeared one by one.  How a place can claim to be a high-end beef restaurant without offering high-end beef dishes eludes me.

As of last night, however, a good ribeye steak has reappeared on the menu.  We had it, and it was first tier.  The signature cornbread is back, too, and the cornbread croutons on the Caesar salad were amazing.  The prime rib is still not on the regular menu, but we have noticed it shows up occasionally as a special.

The Grill remains the most happening spot in Los Altos, though crowds seem to be a bit down.  Maybe the crowds will return now that the menu has been restored.","High-end beef choice restored",154,"Silicon Valley, California",12jan2019,31jan2019

If you want high quality sushi, then you should try out Akane. The main issue for me was that the decor and furnishings were tired and that the place needs to be renovated and modernized. I realize that spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to renovate while losing revenue due to being closed for a period of time is tough for a small business, but that is the price that one has to pay every decade or so, otherwise your customers will start to look elsewhere. Excellent food is key, but so is keeping up with the times. I was also surprised that they didn’t offer brown rice.

I don't trust all the ratings since some from certain sites are fixed but this seemed to live up to most of what was said based on three separate sites.

The Caesar salad was good as where the spring rolls and calamari. Will likely return. Thanks!","Mistral was a nice find for a business dinner",187,"Back East",24jun2019,31jul2018
363758,9,4,"Mistral's food quality has slipped recently, as it has for so many other nearby restaurants, which I suspect is caused by the high operating costs in the area.  Tonight's seafood chowder was marginal, including calamari that bordered on inedible (which is still better than the completely inedible calamari we had recently at La Costanera).  The scallops were just okay, in being tougher than usual; I suspect they had been frozen.  So for the food alone the rating would be a three.  But the ambiance is as good ever, with the ability to pick between the small stylist indoor dining room and an outside covered patio that views the large lagoon.  Both dining areas have sufficient spacing between tables (more so outside) and are sufficiently quiet for easy conversation and relaxation.  And the service was flawless; prompt, professional and personable.  Those factors justify an overall rating of four.","Mixed bag of average food and great ambiance",139,"Belmont, California",15jun2019,30jun2019

363758,11,4,"Several of us had dinner on the covered patio to catch up on business topics.  Ended up being a very nice choice.

Started our evening at the bar while our group arrived.  Bartender was great, served us nicely, without being in our face.  Tried their Belgian Witbier which was very nice.

I was a bit taken back on my arrival with the warning sign in front of the entrance, warning you to not leave valuables in your vehicle.  And making sure you k ow the area is under surveillance.  I guess they have had issues.  But still surprising to me in this area.

We then moved to our table for dinner.  Always nice when you can move your check from the bar to dinner.  Thank you!  We decided to sit in the outdoor patio, although it was completely covered with lots of wind screens.  This made the patio very comfortable even though it was quite a windy chilly eve.

Our server was there immediately and got us settled with menus etc....

We shared their calamari starter.  This was a perfect size for four.  I especially liked one of the three sauces they served it with.  The calamari was crisp and not to chewy.  The sauce was excellent.

I then had their tuna tataki for my entree.  Nice serving of seared tuna, covered in spice, served on a creamy bed of garlic potatoes.  With some very crispy snap pea pods.  Everything was very fresh and tasty.  I was surprised that the tuna was a bit chewy and stringy.  But was still very tasty.

Serving size was a good size for me, not overwhelming in size.

The environment on the patio was great for conversation.  Not to noisy, and some level of privacy for conversation.

So, a very nice spot for dinner.  Nice environment.  Great service, good food.  It’s a bit pricey, but not outrageous.

Often, the restaurant is too noisy for comfortable conversation but we were seated in a corner table by the open doorway, so we could easily hear one another. 
The dessert that evening was excellent, a warm cherry/nectarine tart w/ a tender buttery crust and small scoop of vanilla ice cream, portion size big enough to share but had I not eaten my entire entree, the size is big enough for one too.
We've dined at the Palo Alto and San Francisco venues and have never been disappointed by the food or service. The noise level is what always gives us pause for consideration.

Pros: I thought that their margarita was very good. Made just the way I like it. 

The steak was cooked as ordered and it had a really nice teriyaki flavor to it. Was very good. 

Cons: Some of the appetizers were decent, although mainly average. For example, the wings were juicy but lacked flavors. 

The biggest disappointment though was the spicy jambalaya, which was anything but spicy.

Nola
535 Ramona St.,
Palo Alto, CA 94301 

I went there on a Monday evening for dinner with a coworker.  The restaurant is in downtown Palo Alto so I feared the worst for parking. It turns out there is a city underground lot next door, the lower B level is open to the public after 6 PM and I parked there.  It was nearly empty when I got there and just as empty when I left, it's also free.

We ordered the Crabamole appetizer.  This was very bland and I did not detect any crab or crab flavor.  The avocado must not have been ripe and did not have any flavor at all.  I had the Spicy Jambalaya at the spicy level.  The main feature was the shrimp.  There were a few chunks of chicken, all the other protein ingredients were finely diced so were mostly undetectable.  I expected slices of sausage and cubes of ham.  The spice level was just about right for me.

Service throughout the meal was good.  I was not impressed with the food, the flavor level was just not there for me.  Maybe the dishes all could use a little more salt.  I would not go back, at least for the dishes I had.","Disappointed",17,"Mountain View, California",04may2019,30apr2019

We did get really great specialty drinks- I got a drink with Gin, St Germaine, and I asked for ginger beer instead of club soda. It was excellent! Worth the $10. We shared a variety of nice appetizers and I got the Soba noodle beef salad which was huge and delicious. The prices seemed reasonable and very big portions. Everyone liked what they ordered.

We decided to give them a chance and fix these problems, but we sat and waited and nobody came. After ten minutes one waitress said she would be with us in a minute, so we sat and waited.

The short rib pasta was a new option, but was not spectacular. The tiramisu didn’t taste or look freshly made which was disappointing. 
Wondering if they made and served individual servings, would it be fresher?!

Prices were moderately high for a small group. We took everything home but unfortunately the salad is only best eaten there. It was limp by the time we returned home. Buca is best for large groups to share platters of food. At least they did have a lunch menu which was more reasonably priced from $12.95-$20 instead of large $33 dishes!

If he didn’t want a salad there was no option for the potatoes. The basket of scones instead of the usual large warm scones we used to get was very nice after I realized what it was.    

So we tried it again this week. My husband ordered a side of crisp bacon and was presented with chopped bacon on a plate. The waiter acted like it was okay. Apparently when the chef found out he wasn’t supposed to mix it into the scrambled eggs, he just gave us the chopped bacon instead of frying slices and thought we wouldn’t care. I ordered scones and got two small scones and my husband’s English muffin on the same small plate. No basket of assorted scones like last week though they were Saw baskets on other tables, We had to ask several times before they took off the price of the bacon. I didn’t bother to ask about the quantity of scones.

Service was less than fair. Not attentive. And no one apologized or checked to see if 
we were okay. No one was even out front to thank us or ask how we enjoyed our meal. No wonder there were only four tables filled when Joanie’s down the street had a 30 minute wait. We will not be going back. Patron’s beware.

They were told by the chef it was fine. It was not.  The executive chef of the entire chain of the restaurants came over to the table and apologized.  This was a blatant error however the fact is that it ruined a good steak dinner.  The manager was gracious and apologized.  The waiter dissed us and checked out on service to our table.  The check was for about $125.   The restaurant is required by law to keep egg products, which this sauce is made with, whether pasteurized or not, fresh, warm (110 degrees) and stirred.  Allowing products to sit unattended and served at room temperature can create illness in guests. It can make you sick.  When a restaurant or its wait staff do not tell the truth it is tantamount to questioning all the activities going on inside this kitchen.

364563,9,3,"This is a small menu with nothing extraordinary on it.  We split an Impossible burger and a crab salad.  The crab salad was outstanding with dressing that was not overly sweet.  The pretzel bun added nothing to burgers.  How about brioche?  Or a light whole grain?  More lettuce and tomatoes on the burger would have helped.  Our server brought the wrong salad, and while solving that problem, we ate 3/4 of the burger before getting more catsup and any Dijon.  Fries were served hot but soft - not crisp at all.

365827,3,3,"Iron Gate has been our go- to restaurant for special occasions for many years.   The food is still great and service is fine but our evening was not its best advertisement for a fine dining special occasion.

Before I get to details of our evening, here are some remarks about the restaurant itself-- Still a classic for white table cloth formal dining,  Service itself is outstanding especially when you order a course which brings the captain to your table to flambe a course.   It is pricey (a noticeable increase over our last visit) and an expensive place to bring your own wine ($30 corkage).   Menu is European.   Extensive but pricey wine list.

So what went wrong on this occasion.   We had reservations and were seated right away.  The restaurant had been advised in advance that this was our 50th wedding anniversary dinner

           The front of the house person took us to a table adjacent to tables that were already seated even though there were plenty of tables elsewhere away from those where the existing parties were seated as it was a very slow night-  Warriors playoff game presumed cause;  but those empty tables almost all remained empty the entire evening we were there.   I was told not to take the seat at the table that I chose by the staff person, rather to take one  immediately next to a table of three.

           From the moment we were seated it became unpleasant as the three people began talking louder and louder.   We ordered and received our wine and first course and it became clear one of the ladies next to us was inebriated- slurring words, losing train of thought, repeating herself  and getting louder and louder.   Two other nearby tables were much further along in their meals but the occupants kept having their attention drawn to the table of three  due to the volume and lack of civility. 

           As our meal went on, the other lady at the same table clearly began to also get drunk and therefore louder and the ""gentleman""  began telling stories that were offensive and crude.  

           Eventually, the original problem lady began using foul language and practically yelling her words.   I suppose we should have asked to be moved but we were already half way though our meal.   It finally got so bad that I turned to the lady and asked her to ""watch your language""  apparently loud enough get others attention.   It got better but not by much.

          As the waiter brought our coffee, the captain came to the table and asked us if we would prefer to have our coffee in the bar area where there was a band playing.

          We moved.  Then the ""gentleman"" who had been next to us left with his wife or girlfriend and then reentered and did apologize to us (much too little and way too late).  As he left,  the woman who had been obnoxious from the beginning departed without a word to us.   

          Then the waiter and the captain both came by and apologized acknowledging that the threesome had been a problem from the moment they arrived.

        So while the bad behavior clearly was the responsibility of the customers,   the staff knew there was a problem before we were seated, placed us immediately next to the problem table, and never said anything to the offending parties or offered us a warning or asked if we wished to be seated elsewhere until I spoke to the offender.

365827,8,5,"Went with friends to celebrate my birthday (on a Thursday evening) and was VERY pleased with the food and service. The abalone (farmed) appetizer was tender (NOT chewy as is so often the case) plus the sauce was light (this is a menu that tends toward French cuisine which can be heavy so I was very pleased with the flavor and texture of the sauce). My next course was ""Veal Picatta"" which was also very tender with a light sauce and capers (I believe capers are pickled seed pod but these added a burst of flavor--more than the average caper). There was also a nice blend of accompanying vegetables. I finished with a mixed berry souffle (L'accent aigu on the ending ""e"") because it is my favorite dessert and it was my birthday and I was ready for the calories. They removed the souffle with a large spoon when they brought it to the table. I'm used to eating it from the ramekin--a method fraught with the danger of burning your mouth in your eagerness to partake. Again the sauce was superb. I was very pleased it was on the menu. My friends enjoyed their wine while I stuck with water to save the calories for the souffle. My friend's ""Steak Dianne"" was prepared at the table which was fun to watch and she said it was very tender and flavorful.

I had the centered cut fillet with medium rare with truffle and Pate on top. It was good.

The best part was the soufflé. I had the one with Grand mariner sauce, wow the soufflé was super tender and smooth! It melted when you ate it! Highly recommended! Can’t miss the soufflé. ","Very nice steak & Souffe",96,"Hong Kong, China",04apr2019,30apr2019

Wasn’t overfilled with mushrooms either. The veal picatta was well cooked and tasty, but I wouldn’t order it again because it seems like an ordinary dish. But the steak Diane Flambé was amazing! So tender and flavorful and of course a good show. Finally, the shared soufflé grand marnier was very good, however, I’ve made this at home (with all of the proper ingredients) and it was slightly noticeably better at this restaurant. So I would order another dessert next time (but if you do order the grand marnier, order it 30 minutes in advance).The decor is classic and romantic. The waiters are well mannered and formal, however they seemed impersonal. This restaurant definitely attracts the older crowd. Pricing seems very appropriate to what you get.

Reviews were good so we decided to give it a try ( we were unaware that this place is an institution in the area). We are not young but we definitely brought the average age down- it not a positive or negative just give the place a certain feel. The decor was very nice but dated. For us it almost felt refreshing. The restaurant was packed ( 7:15 reservation). We were initially seated in the first table as you enter the dining area. Our friends ask to change the table and I’m glad he did because I usually don’t ask to change table especially if the restaurant is full but it totally changed our experience. The manager told us we will have to wait a bit at the bar but it was worth it and 10 minutes later we were seated in a better located table. We started with Caesar salad for 2 which was very good especially if you like garlic ( we do:). I had a scallop dish and my husband had steak which was good ( not the best we had but very good).

365830,16,1,"Let me preface this by saying I've was a loyal customer of Kabul's in San Carlos since I first came here in 1997.  We've eaten in, taken out and recommended many MANY people to the restaurant over the years.  We went to dine there several times after 9/11 -- when many people were initially staying away. That said, I had an unfortunate experience this past November - and it has definitely left a sour taste, and I haven't been back since.

Because we have been customers for so long, my husband had once mentioned that ""it would be fun to have a dinner party"" at their long banquet table off to the right when you first walk into the restaurant.  I knew this was something he would like -- so I thought it would be fun to have a surprise party for him at that table in the restaurant.

I called the restaurant to inquire about the table and was able to reserve it for 25-30 people.  I then requested a date change -- some family members wanted to come into town for the surprise, so I called to ask the restaurant if it was possible to move the date and reserve the banquet table for a different date.  I told them that if it was not possible to get that table on another day, that we would keep the original day/time.  They assured me that it was not a problem.  We had close to 30 people coming to the party -- including out-of-town family/friends - and I worked with the restaurant to define a ""set menu"" so that things could go a bit more smoothly.  All seemed to be good. 

So, I was shocked when the night before the party, I get a call from the hostess who is ""confirming our reservation -- and I'm told that ""no, you don't have that table... because another larger party with 40 people called.""  We were literally replaced because the restaurant got a better offer. The hostess confirmed that the second reservation had come after I had already booked the space.  I protested and the hostess had the audacity to tell me ""we always tell people that they are not guaranteed to get that table.""  NOT TRUE.  I made it very clear that I was booking the party SPECIFICALLY because I wanted to enjoy that space.  I was very upset - but the hostess (who during our conversation was also talking to others) asked me ""What do you want me to do?"" I said  ""I want you to make good on the reservation -- if the other party called after, you should be telling them that they will be put in the main dining room -- that you made a mistake.""  She refused.  

She said, ""No, I cannot do that.  Do you want to cancel or can I confirm?""  Let's be clear here... is was 7:30 p.m. on the Friday night before a Saturday night party.  I had 30 guests showing up for a party less than 24 hours away -- one family was flying in the next day, another was already on the road from out of town.  I was in a terrible position.  The owner then called me and told me ""don't worry... I can't get you the table but you will have excellent food and excellent service.""  Sorry, but that doesn't cut it -- that is what I expect in any case. With a large social gathering like this, there was no way we could have had the party in a crowded dining room... we knew that our party would be moving around, visiting... we could not have done that in the crowded dining room without bothering other diners.  That simply would not have worked -- it would have been a terrible experience for everyone.  

I tried to explain all of this to the restaurant owner but, honestly, he was just as impervious has the hostess.  He really did not see any problem in simply ""cancelling"" our request when a better offer come along.  His exact words were ""What do you expect me to do? It;s a busy time of year and I'm a small restaurant...""  That's EXACTLY my point -- it is a busy time and I made reservations well in advance knowing that is necessary in order to book a space.  If a later (last minute) request comes in... you need to honor your other commitments.  But they simply don't see it that way. No amount of discussion mattered. I started to wonder if perhaps I was wrong to think that this was horrible treatment!

Thankfully, I scrambled and was able to get help from a WONDERFUL restaurant -- I told the manager of that (also small) restaurant my situation.  He was shocked by the treatment we received and was thankfully able to accommodate us... and we ended up with a much nicer, more private dining experience.  The food was actually even better than Kabul's -- and didn't cost more.   I will write a separate 5-star review for that restaurant.  

In the end, we actually had a better birthday celebration as a result -- and now we know Kabul's is not the great restaurant we thought it was.  Our eyes have been opened.    After over 3 decades of being a customer, Kabul's has lost our business and the referred business we used to send.   There are 5 other local families at the party that night who also do not plan to return -- every single person was SHOCKED at how badly this was handled. 

I don't take pleasure in writing this review.  It saddens me that a local once-favorite restaurant would do this.   That said, while the food is good I do not recommend having a large party/group event there... you might be replaced if a better offer comes along.","terrible large party experience... sad to have to walk away from this business.",3,"",15jan2019,30nov2018

367333,13,5,"Milagro’s has been a popular downtown restaurant for a long time, at least a decade, which means that reservations are necessary, particularly on a weekend. When we arrived for our 5 p.m. reservation on a Friday, the patio tables were already full with a lively crowd, and the interior was also 75% full. So much for my concern about dining unfashionably early! Happy hour is from 3-5pm. We were seated in the back room which has a large tv that was tuned to the Masters golf tournament, and were glad to be in there because it was quiet as compared to the main room which was quite loud.

The drinks menu offers an interesting selection of margaritas by the glass, half pitcher (3 servings), or full pitcher. We ordered guacamole for our starter. It was fresh, delicious and expensive! We also enjoyed the fresh chips with a selection of 3 different kinds of salsa. I chose the grilled mahi mahi salad, which was flavorful and satisfying. My husband chose the pork platter, and there was so much meat that he couldn’t finish it all - that is a rare occurrence for him.

The bill for 2 of us, including 1/2 pitcher of margaritas, guacamole and 2 entrees was ~$90, not a cheap night out, but definitely a satisfying meal.","Fun Atmosphere & Tasty Food",333,"Redwood City, California",13apr2019,30apr2019

Wrong!
I don't know how this lovely restaurant got the name ""Village Pub,"" but the only connection I can make that it's in a small village in northern California -- Woodside.

It is a California elegant restaurant, expensive, but worth the money. It's warm, deep red walls and lowlights provide a comfortable ambiance for dining and warm conversations. Service is excellent and attentive, and the amuse bouche and complimentary ice cream brownies provide a special touch. My husband ordered scallops ($39), and six big ones filled his plate, accompanied by a small serving of vegetables. I loved my steak tartare, moistened by the traditional quail egg (which is optional). We went on a Sunday night and the carpets and low ceilings kept down the noise level.

Needless to say, all the food was fantastic - from the tagliatelle with freshly shave truffles (which we shared at the table) to the entrees (I thoroughly enjoyed the scallops, pictured) right thru to the desserts.

When you dine at a fine restaurant like this, you shouldn't worry too much about the bill but I have to admit that I did get a bit of sticker shock when it arrived: $1400 for 5 ppl - which did include ample amounts of French wine - was a bit rich for my taste but, in the end, it's hard to complain when one has such a stellar experience.","Amazing",243,"Glen Cove, New York",15jan2019,31dec2018

It being our first time there our excellent waiter Tim explained the menu and the various “favorites”.  We started with the Tamarine Taste mixed plate ($25 for two).  This had two unique items: Taro Rolls and Tea Leaf Beef (an Asian answer to Greek meat dolmates, but better), plus a small green papaya salad with dried beef, and two Shrimp Spring Rolls.  The Spring Rolls were fine but ordinary, and I feel that an alternate item would do the plate more justice.
We were in the mood for fish and ordered the Lemongrass Seabass and the Clay Pot Black Cod (a.k.a. butterfish).  Both dishes were outstanding!  Not large portions, but so nicely/perfectly done.  The Clay Pot is one of Tamarine’s true specialties -- the cooked fish sauce is wonderfully aromatic.  So, be sure to order a side of Jasmine rice to soak up every bit of that sauce.  
We skipped dessert, but the restaurant presented my wife with a nice “Happy Birthday” ginger cake and a card.
I would add that one can order a variety of noodle dishes.  But, it would be a shame to forego the unique and creative main dishes at this restaurant that can make the visit a memorable experience.","Go for the unique dishes and celebrate",13,"Carmel, California",13jun2019,30jun2019

Our gathering had an array of excellent dishes. Of special note were the baked whole branzini  - so tender, boneless and escorted by noodles and veggies — and the aubergine  - which tasted levels above any eggplant I’ve had. Also try the glass noodles and double cooked steak. 

You might not expect beignets for dessert in a Vietnamese restaurant  — but they are very good here and offered with a tropical touch inside - banana.

Tamarine is understandably popular. We were there on a Thursday evening- and it was packed even at 9:30 PM when we left. So, reservations should be considered. There is bar seating.","Deliciously Enjoyable",62,"Beaver Creek, Colorado",02mar2019,31mar2019

To these we added crab and glass noodles, Empress rice and charred Brussel sprouts. We shared all dishes. Of the dishes, I particularly liked the salt and pepper calamari, shaking beef (Cubed filet mignon seared with soy, garlic & onions) and Brussel sprouts. We may have ordered too many soy based dishes and it may have been better if we had tried their fresh shrimp spring roll recommended by Michelin.

BUT, because of its popularity, it's often very crowded and thus also quite noisy. Especially in the second small room, next to the bar area, some of the tables are also very close together, so it's a hard place to have a good conversation, especially as the evening progresses. When it's warm out, there's an outdoor dining area (facing Murphy Street, so with some traffic going by), which is more peaceful. Given how many people love the food here (and I highly recommend the chicken beriani dejaj and the several fish dishes), I've been hoping for years that DishDash would expand to better accommodate the crowds. Instead, they've opened a couple of satellite Dish 'n Dash restaurants (where you order at the counter), with a similar menu but more of a casual vibe. Murphy Street in Sunnyvale is really ""restaurant row,"" so there may not be space for DishDash iteself to expand there.

First of all it takes 30-45 minutes to get in, and they don't take reservations.  You sign up and wait for your name to be called.  Not TOO bad if the weather's nice but if it isn't...They were named Mt. View's Top Sushi Restaurant in 2016, 2017 and 2018, which helps to explain the line but If this is the best Mt. View has to offer they are hurting really bad.

We ordered the spider roll (deep-fried soft shell crab) an eel roll and some nigiri.  We also ordered the FRESH wasabi, a miso soup and seaweed salad.  The soup was for my friend, so I didn't taste that, but I did all the rest.  Also, hot sake, which was fine and cheap.

The service was good.  No problems with the waiters/waitresses.

1.  The crab in the roll was insufficiently crisp.  It was a little soggy.
2.  The eel roll was ok, nothing special either way.
3.  The seaweed didn't have the real crunch of FRESH seaweed, it was softer, like it was past its prime.
4.  The ""fresh"" wasabi was the same paste you get anywhere.  I actually had fresh wasabi the previous night at another sushi restaurant (yes, I had sushi 2 nights in a row because it's my favorite food).  It's like finely minced scallions, except it's horseradish.  The stuff I got at Sushi Tomi was paste, which means it's ground up and mixed with water and NOT fresh.

Also, this is an excellent choice for healthy kids meals on a regular basis. All of the kids meals come with fruit or vegetable, and the staff are great about making adjustments. The kids menu also doubles as a scavenger hunt, you will see other kids wandering about the restaurant, hunting among all the crazy items hung on the walls and ceiling to check off items on their list. It's not the cheapest place to eat, but if you're looking for a place that can serve as a healthy family dinner with everyone around the table, this is great.

it is clearly a great place for a quick lunch or even a quick business meeting. There was a lot of seating both indoors and out. Seats were filled by every profession from the utility worker on lunch break to the tech start up guy that wanted a burger and a beer before returning to work on the next big thing. 

You order at the counter then take your number. You will be called at which point you retrieve your meal and grab your condiments and  utensils. Regulars just about run you over as they hustle to and fro. Our group pounced on an empty table that we eventually expanded to nine people. 

After ordering the food comes up pretty quickly, even with a long line stretching out to the door when we arrived. The burgers most people ordered were sloppy good. They come with a bag of potato chips but we ordered some French fries and onion rings to share. They were devoured immediately.

466467,6,4,"I was there for lunch today (February 2019) for the very first time. Wow. Huge crowd. St John’s is clearly very popular. I would even say it is the most popular lunch place I have seen in the South Bay. When I arrived at about 11:40 a.m. the place was already about 80% full and there were about 20 people in line ahead of me. And there are a lot of tables plus a bar.

Upon arrival, the customer waits in a cue to order food, then selects a table. And the little circular buzzer gizmo goes off to alert you when the food is ready.

The crowd was about 90% male and the vast majority were 40 years old and younger. 

The noise level was massive. I will guess that the decibel level is close to the point of causing discomfort and hearing damage. Hey, but that did not seem to bother most people as far as I could tell. They seemed to revel in LOUD conversation.

I ordered that day’s special, which was half a chicken and French fries or salad. The chicken was perfectly cooked; tender and moist. They put bq on the side so the customer could use it or not; in other words the chicken is not cooked with the bq sauce on it. The French fries were mediocre, that is, nothing special at all. The half chicken was not large but it was plenty filling and the cost on sale was $11.95 + tax + no tip since no table wait staff. 

I asked another customer what food was good and he replied: “Everything.” I asked another customer how his hamburger was and he shrugged and said: “OK.”

In the future, I am unlikely to return to St John’s due to the excessive noise level. However, when warm weather returns, I might try to arrive early for lunch and sit outside where there is less noise.

Chef's platter is made up of 3 of the appetizers: Aushak- Sambosa and pakawra-e-badenjan($15 lunch/$17 dinner), was chosen because I could not decide between the appetizers so thought having 3 of the chef's favorites would give me a good tasting, I was not disappointed.  Note that the Chef's platter is an entree because of its size.

I loved the Aushak, that was my favorite of the 3 appetizers.  Flat dumplings stuffed with spring onion, topped with yogurt and meat sauce, sprinkled with dried mint. The pakawra-e-badenjan, consisted of batter dipped and fried slices of eggplant topped with yogurt and meat sauce.

I also shared a Karaie, tender lamb served with a thick stewed sauce with carrots and green peppers served along side of pallow ($15 at lunch/$18 dinner). The portion was substantial.  The pallow was flavorful with hints of cinnamon.

The down side?  I would have skipped the salad however I did not realize that one came with the meal until it showed up.  The salad was wilted, brown edged iceberg and romaine lettuce with 2 grape tomatoes and 2 slices of cucumber with a drizzle of  a white creamy dressing sprinkled with dried mint.  I took a bite, it was not to my preference, I truly do not like to see lettuce of this poor quality served in a restaurant. The salad was not a nice way to begin the meal.

But what we really really appreciated was that in the more formal dining room area, it was actually possible to hold a civilized conversation with others at our table.  No shouting required, no crazy bright acoustics driving you mad, and we could - are you sitting down? - actually hear each other.  And guess what, other tables were having conversations too!   If you've been eating out at many restaurants in the western US lately, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

We asked the waiter if the halibut was wild, and the response was yes. Our surprise came with the second dish when we saw a  trout in our dishes instead of the halibut. We thought it was a mistake. We asked and the worse was the reaction and response ... it was not a mistake, it was a fraud: after several minutes waiting three guys came to the table, 2 waiters and a manager to explain that they had no more halibut and they had decided to serve a trout. Apologies for the miss-communication and that was it! ... We were in shock. Our waiter was in shock. They basically ruined our Friday dinner. We thought about leaving or staying and we decided to stay and finish dinner with the rest of the order. We had to ask to return the trout dishes, it was never offered.  When paying, the full bill came to us without including the trout that we never eat we never ordered. We call the manager again to explain our dissatisfaction with the dinner. He didn't offer a more elaborated explanation of what had happened, he didn't even try. Just  took the bill and deducted two glasses of Burgundy from the drinks portion, probably thinking this was the explanation we deserved.

My sweetheart and I were visiting the Bay Area and having lunch that day with an old friend.  He suggested the PA Creamery, so we happily agreed.

We arrived a bit early for lunch, at 11:30am, so lots of tables free. We were seated promptly. Menus came quickly and drink orders taken.

The menu is pretty typical diner-esque, with breakfast all day. So, of course, I ordered breakfast, in this case, the pancakes. They were quite good, and served with real maple syrup. (I often complain about places that make good pancakes then ruin them with the fake corn-syrup based stuff.)  I ordered the pancakes with fresh kiwis on top, but they came with a whole variety of fruit on top ... which wasn't bad. Of course, they offered to bring me a new order with just the kiwi but it was fine.  And the pancakes were excellent.

My sweetheart ordered the pastrami sandwich, which was quite tasty, with excellent meat, but with the tiniest amount of meat I've ever seen on a deli sandwich.

With all of this, we had the normal brewed coffee, which was quite reasonable. They also have fresh squeezed juices (a big deal for my sweetheart) at a reasonable price.

The pies and cakes looked amazing, but we were too full to partake. I'm VERY picky about pie crust (and make a proper one), and these looked spot on.

We recently dropped in for lunch. We ordered three simple dishes, all standards. Egg rolls, the chicken salad and honey pecan prawns. When the egg rolls arrived they we the most delicious we've ever had...anywhere. Good start. Next was the chicken salad. What happened? It was bland as cafeteria fare. Not enough seasoning; not enough cilantro. Not enough at taste. Then came the honey pecan prawns. It was shockingly bad. First, it was cold. Not tepid. Not lukewarm. Cold. We would normally cut the prawn with a fork. Not these babies. They were tough as dried rubber. Naturally, we sent it back. Our waiter offered a half hearted explanation stating the dish is colder because the mayonnaise covering it is cold. Sorry, not buying that explanation. We've enjoyed this dish many times and it has never been cold. A few minutes later the dish returned steaming hot. BUT, the prawns remained as tough as before. Clearly they were either old prawns (I doubt that) or the chef didn't know (or care) how they were prepared.

Peeled shrimp, grilled asparagus and smoke salmon with capers. A pastry partner ensures the desserts are top quality: macarons or flourless chocolate torte, tiramisu, and an endless selection of cakes cut in small bites so you can try more than one!

I always remember the restaurant being crowded. Not this time as it was almost empty for a Wednesday evening early dinner. We arrived early enough for happy hour and ordered the old fashion cocktails and fried calamari appetizers. A great way to start our dinner at reasonable prices. Our server was the bartender as we were seated very close to the bar. He was great and very helpful as he said he could also serve us our dinners at the same location. I have always been a fan of the BBQ ribs here and ordered a half slab. Very good. My wife ordered the pork tenderloin and she said it was excellent.

I had their blackened Salmon, with au gratin  potatoes and vegetable medley.  Was very good.  Also got to try their Heirloom tomato plate... which was excellent.  Everyone else enjoyed their meal also.  The quality of seafood here has always been quite good.

The lamp on the table was an indication, of how maintenance has been let go - the place really needs a revamp and freshening up, but the food was the main reason we went Went for lunch,  sat down and the waiter came, got some water & ice teas, as well as ordering some calamari.  Then the waiter disappeared,  I thought another waiter was ours, and I advised we were ready to order, he said he would send the waiter over. Soon afterward we ordered our meal. The calamari came right after this,  The calamari was average at best, the small squid was chewy to the point of almost inedible - the rings were ok, but all the items were greasy, not crispy - the sweet sauce was very good.   Then came the lunch, (came up in like 2 minutes, were barely into the calamari)  and that was the last we saw of our server for a while, as we stared at empty ice T glasses for way too long, also wanted some more butter - that by the time he came was too late.   Fish & Chips, very sad - Fries looked like low grade cheap frozen ones, cooked in old oil & left under the heat lamp for an extended period of time,  the coleslaw is better at applebee's & the fish was very very dry, and no seasoning at all - Gorton's may have been better.   I had the scallops and prosciutto  - they were o.k, no seasoning at all & no sauce, was given tarter sauce - but would have rather had a little more of a marinade / garlic butter.... don't want to cover up scallops with mayo & diced pickles.  The veggies again were very very bland, looked like they were boiled - no seasoning, - the rice may have been the highlight of the plate.

Dessert was again shared, the Tiramasu which the staff had talked up, and which was very good (a touch too sweet perhaps) and generous enough for two.

The staff were very enthusiastic and several people dressed casually, who I would have taken as joint owners of the restaurant, came to chat with us and others. I also heard them belting out Happy Birthday at another table.

Last night I brought my parents (local), my brother and his son who came in from out of town.  None of them had been to Alice's before. 
I had to get some attention after sitting for 10 minutes with no waiter.  Our table was not cleaned and I had to remind them to do so.  We got our drink menu for 5 minus 2 drinks (root beer).  Our waiter assumed my parents wanted to share a burger and didn't confirm his assumption ""do you want to share or do you want me to cut that in half?""  I recall my father saying and showing 2 fingers after mom say what she wanted.
I thought they might comp our drinks (root beer and lemonade) but not so.

This is the best place to go with kids--sit on the back deck and let the kids run around on the fenced lawn below. The only downside is that everything comes with chips on the side, so if you want your kid to eat a vegetable that's not a fried potato, you have to order a side salad or something. But they do have Beyond Burgers, so that's awesome, and the Happy Hour menu on the back deck often has sliders or nachos--about half the time my daughter orders off the Happy Hour selections. Also, it took us years to discover this, but the coffee cake is outstanding.

517107,3,5,"We discovered this restaurant in 1969 when we first migrated to Silicon Valley. At the time the restaurant was famous for its burritos and the insufferable rudeness of one of the owners who acted like a Marine drill sergeant. At that time the Bustamonti family owned it and the sisters ran it. We were so happy with the food that we visited them almost weekly until about 6 years ago when the restaurant fell on hard times under new management. The recipes were the same but the chef could not pull them off. Last we heard they were about to go under and we sadly wrote off our favorite Mexican restaurant. Fast forward to last Saturday nite when my wife and I said “I wonder if Estrellita’s is still around”. We checked on line and saw the menu was the same as our last visit so we decided to give it another go. When we walked in the decorations were almost identical to the old restaurant and even had some of the old servers and hostess Adrianna. She greeted us with a hug and said that everything has been back to normal for many years since we were last there. The Gourmet burritos were the signature dish and so we tried them. Yep to die for almost exactly like the originals in the 1970’s with one small exception. The old green chile sauce was replaced by a tomatillo sauce. On our second visit I found that if you order the burrito with half red and half green when mixed together it actually tastes better than the original. The menu has expanded significantly since the old days and now there are some very unusual southern Mexican dishes that you seldom encounter. Examples Chile en Nogada, Cochinita Pibil, Pipian, Chicken Oaxaca. We are now back on our once a week visit schedule to what feels like an old lost friend.

547427,1,4,"This nice old open-air place has a number of nice renovations - while keeping the old character of a rural/student/beer garden hangout. The place is deservedly popular-so much so that the parking is bizarre and hazardous - only one way in and out, with cars all jamming in so you cannot back out. Food is ok, not overly exciting. Beer is good and the pizza truck looked inviting. Some shakedown issues - especially the yellow jacket nest (3rd table from the bar, on the left, next to the creek) needs attention. The open-air view of the creek is a nice idea, as are all the umbrellas for shade. A big improvement.

547427,2,5,"What can anyone really add to the lore of the Alpine Inn (formerly Rosotti's)? It has served the locals and travelers as a stage coach stop and watering hole, and not much appears to have changed since 1858 (except Uber and Lyft have replaced the stage coaches).

The food is basic - sandwiches and fries (very good fries). This is not health food, nor would a vegan find much of interest here. But if you want to soak up some early California vibes, knock back a pitcher of beer and eat a cooked-to-order double burger with cheese and bacon, you won't go wrong here.

This place isn't for everyone, but if you do go you will mingle with billionaires, hedge fund managers, soccer moms & dads, bikers, attorneys, college students, locals just unwinding - and you might have trouble telling them apart. Unpretentious only begins to describe the atmosphere and clientele.

Note: the Alpine Inn has new ownership (local families saving it from oblivion), and the restaurant is closed for another few weeks while they update the kitchen and address ADA requirements. The historic facade isn't changing, you will still park on gravel and the picnic table area out back will be waiting for your party.","160+ years old and still at it.",14,"Portola Valley, California",03mar2019,31jan2019

548110,2,3,"Sunday dinner for fathers day and a birthday celebration.   Result an almost three hour meal process arriving at 5:15 with reservations and finishing after 8 pm.  Not good when you have a seven year old in the group.   Almost an hour with only one order of calamari before any salads arrived.  Waitress very nice and apologized for the delay throughout the entire meal.  Had to ask for water refills quite a few times and each time water was spilled by server onto the table without any clean-up or comment.

Restaurant was crowded and quite noisy.  I found wood chairs hard to sit on for such a long period of time.

In my opinion, food is so-so and quite overpriced.   Any steak is going to cost a minimum of $36 and they go up from there.   Base salad is $10.   You do get two choices of items to go with steaks- in my case about 15 french fries and five asparagus.   I found my salad being delivered dried out, no offer to add pepper and needed to add oil and vinegar.   $40 plus steak was relatively small and cooked unevenly-one end medium well and the other medium rare.   

I understand you can find group-on coupons that will offer a shared salad and small entree for less.

As you walk in, I noticed a sign warning of parking lot car break-ins so be sure to remove any valuables from sight.  We did see a law enforcement vehicle drive thru the parking lot but under the circumstances I would suggest the restaurant add a security person on meal times.","Skip on a holiday.

The location is a bit strange at side of the highway, close to the airport and actually next where the choppers are parked. There is a fast food restaurant next door making the location a bit more iffy especialy with the multiple sign asking for not leaving ay valuables at your car. When you get inside, things are very different:  the place has good, stylish décor and you feel like you are in a steakhouse. We ordered the bruschetta as a shared starter (it was good), then I opted for the FILET MIGNON MEDALLIONS AU POIVR with steamed Broccoli and French fries, while my wife ordered the BLACKENED CAJUN FILET MIGNON with baked potato and creamed spinach.  My meal was a home run, it was delicious, juicy and flavorful - the broccoli was crisp exactly as a like it. My wife liked her meal but felt that her meat was a little dry although she really loved her sides. We finished up with a crème brulee which was also delicious.

The restaurant was busy but not full, there were empty tables to be seen.  NO table service when we were seated, we waited almost 30 min before someone took our drink orders.  We ordered food and waited another 45 min.  The drinks came with the food.

The food was so-so at best and 3 of the 9 side orders were wrong.  My husband ordered a burger cooked med.  When delivered it was rare, actually cold in the middle.  He ate around the edges.  When he told the fellow clearing the table he laughed and moved away.

Our granddaughter wanted an ice cream cake which Izzys said they would stick in the freezer while we ate.
By the time we ate this terrible meal all we wanted to do was leave.  We asked for the cake to bring home and it was clear they had not not bothered to put it in the freezer.......what a mess, and those cakes are not cheap.

614188,1,3,"Xanh offers Asian fusion food; not sure I would identify it as Vietnamese cuisine. I was not  impressed with the food quality for the cafeteria lunch. Here is the routine at lunchtime: The customer is greeted by a host. We then select a table. Then the customer goes through the cafeteria food line where there is a huge variety of choices. The meats were small in size and very tasty. There was some kind of meatball that was delicious. The beef soup was quite flavorful; I liked it. Both the noodles and green beans were plain and boring; why do they not add seasoning/spices to those two dishes like they do to the meats?
The cafeteria lunch price is $16.30 including tax, not including tip (June 2019). Indoor lightening is too dark to read the signs that identify the cafeteria food. When I was there, some of the food choices had no identifying label and that is a mistake that a customer-friendly restaurant would never make. Let me clarify – when I was young with perfect vision perhaps I could have read those food labels; but, with age, my vision is less than ideal. Is Xanh discriminating against people who have less than perfect vision and/or are older? I think so. Suggestion to management: Put bright lights tot illuminate the names of each cafeteria food. Surely you can afford that. When weather permits, outdoor seating in front on Castro Street is quite pleasant.

While the regular menu items (we ordered riblets and shrimps) were just average, the salad bar was very good.  Besides being able to make your own salad, there were also ready made salad like the Chinese salad (with Mandarin orange slices and oriental dressing) and the Caesar salad were both very good.  There was also a salad with strawberry and blueberry with a sweet dressing that I particularly liked.  Then there were the usual suspects of different kinds of soup and desserts (jello, pudding, ice cream) and for those craving for more protein, make-you-own tacos and spaghetti with meatballs.  Not a gourmet meal by any means, but quite tasty and satisfying in its own right.  Parking is convenient right outside the restaurant with wheelchair enabled access.

i got there first, not sure if we were going to be 5 people or 6--they put me in the back room at a table that would have seated 10--i agreed since it seemed cooler back there--that feeling didn't last long.  we wound up being 5 people and there was another large table that had about 15 people, so it was very very noisy.  like, can't hear the person on the other side of the person sitting next to me at all, noisy.  two of the others got there fairly soon and at that point we knew the other two were running late and we wanted to order drinks and appetizers.  apparently, you are invisible until your entire party is seated--after ten minutes, i got up and found our waiter.  the food was actually very tasty and probably one of the most reasonably priced meals i had during my trip to the bay area--i am not 100% sure that they gave me what i ordered since i was expecting lamb cubes and got ground lamb on my kebab, but it tasted good--the other thing i tried was their baba ganoush--also good.  we had to get up one other time to find our waiter--i think people were overworked and maybe overcome by the heat?  anyway, it wasn't a great experience but i would probably try them again on a different day with different weather, in a different room, since the food was good.","really 3.5 stars but that's not possible",105,"Chicago, Illinois",21aug2019,31aug2019

Comparing prices, we found most restaurants to be about the same.  Once we got over the prices on menus for a basic old style breakfast, we decided to just splurge and enjoy. Stacks is wonderful! The service from all staff is warmly welcoming, friendly, and attentive.  Pepe was our first server and is a super star of hospitality. We have now been twice.  I had mushroom and cheese omelette on trip one.  It is served with fantastic potatoes which are shaved and pan crisped.  Absolutely delicious.  It came with a bagel and wonderful jams are on the table.  My husband got the bacon waffle and also eggs and sourdough toast.  He thought the waffle was really good.  Returning yesterday, I ordered a ham and cheese omelette and asked for substitution of sourdough toast for the bagel. My husband got the Chocolate Divine waffle, and was concerned it might be too sweet.  Jorge assured him it would be the perfect savory sweet combination, and he was right.  My husband loved it.  He still must have his bacon, eggs, and toast, so we left stuffed, but happy.  The coffeee is also very good here.  We cannot say enough about Pepe's contribution to the welcoming atmosphere on both days.  The servers seem to help each other out and all appear welcoming and attentive, but we think we had the real winners with Pepe and Jorge.  The restaurant decor and general vibe is one of welcoming and lingering over coffee, newspaper, and conversation.

833092,0,3,"This is probably the most difficult review we've done.  We made three visits to this coffee establishment and well ... you decide.  Our first visit was early in the day and was simple.We asked the person behind the counter to bring out what she would order and the coffee was great and the new item (a small piece of French Toast) was OK but a bit sweet. So 4 stars.  
        Our 2nd visit did not go well.  Same morning but different person behind the counter. We asked her for what she would have and while the food choice was better the coffee .. well how do you rate a coffee that takes 18 minutes and that's shorter than it would have been if we had left it up to the staff.  We gave them three chances and still no recognition of the fact that the order was .. well not submitted. This experience was a 1 star for the food choice and -2 stars for service.  The coffee, once made was not worth the wait.  (sigh).  So a -1 for this visit.   
       The third visit was later in the morning and started out well.  We needed a semi private place to have a Google mtg, and Red Rock has that, and then some.  The 2nd floor overlooks downtown Mountain View, is bright and their is original art on the walls. There is even a nook that Red Rock rents out for private meetings.  Perfect for our needs in the future.  So at this point 6 stars, but then we ordered an espresso at their alternate bar .. a great idea if you don;t ask more than one question.  Simply the server had a bit of an attitude and, while the espresso was great it was not the warm friendly experience you'd expect in Mountain View.
   By chance we had a very nice conversation with a manager/owner.  She was great, friendly, informative, competent, etc.  She was more of a customer than worker during our visit and in fact.while we were experiencing the longest wait for a coffee ever, she ordered, had a conversation, received her order, and left.  
       Honestly, we almost thought of not reviewing this coffee house  on Trip Adviser.  But then we realized that Red Rock is a victim of being labeled the best, the #1,   the ""The Place to have coffee in Mountain View.""
        The bottom line, coffee is pretty good, the location upstairs is perfect and worth checking out either by stairs or elevator and saves a 1 star review.  If you are a local and laptop worker its a great place to hang and work.We will probably visit Google a couple more times in the next year.  We will give Red Rock a 2nd chance and see what happens.","The Tale of Three Visits",94,"Cambridge, Massachusetts",12mar2019,28feb2019

I've had Krispy Kreme before, while traveling or when a family visitor brings some as a kind gesture - in any case, always welcome and delicious! Now, I spied the unique sign and remembered the advertisements for their Reese's FILLED peanut butter doughnuts! I went on an adventure - hoping for first taste of this limited time treat! The location is in a small shopping center right off main roads and freeway US 101. The building looks like most other Krispy Kremes, and featured an outdoor eating area as well. The location was clean, and well decorated. One big attraction for me (first time in a long time type reaction!) was to watch a billion (more or less!) raised donuts get made, from coming off a rack, into a fry bath and then coated with a curtain of sugary glaze. Too much! I watched for a while, fascinated by the whole process. Eventually I pulled myself away and went to the counter, finding dozens of flavors from which to choose. I picked a few of my favorites (key lime, chocolate filled with custard, NOT the Krispy Kreme - a kind of whipped creme - and a couple of filled Oreo cookies). I then ordered the Reese's donuts, and to my complete horror and dismay, I was told ""they were out right now - they go fast!"" Granted, it was early evening, but for the love of Sweetness, make MORE! Ughhhh . . . my journey for first taste of these would continue. Luckily, I had my back-up dozen . . . and I noticed a display of milks in many flavors! I spied a Root Beer and an Orange Cream among them, so I took a couple for tasting. I love milk, and chocolate milk is a runner-up - but these milks are delicious! They come in heavy glass bottles, but are small, and a little pricey. However, try one - or two - and you'll find a new treat! The Root Beer and Orange Cream flavors came through nicely, with the silky texture of milk, a perfect liquid delight. I will look for new flavors next time - maybe Banana? Other than the Reese's let down, my visit here was a nice break. Good donuts, new milk flavors, a clean and nicely decorated building and a conveyor belt of endless donuts - everything came together, and the staff was very patient and friendly with myself and others trying to decide on a few donut flavors out of too many choices!

I had a grilled pastrami sandwich and the sour dough roll was so tough and stale I needed a knife. The pastrami portion of the sandwich also wasnt very large. My wife had the brisket salad bowl. The brisket was very dry and she couldnt finish it. The beers were great as usual and in the past I have always enjoyed the double cheeseburgers with bacon.

882880,0,4,"We recently joined some old friends that we hadn't seen in awhile for conversation and catching up on a Saturday night.  The City Pub seemed an ideal place since the weather was mild and it had a nice outdoor seating area, perfect for conversation.  If you absolutely have to stay up with your favorite sports team, there are three TVs hanging above the large bar inside.

The cuisine is described as pub grub, which I think is fair description of the food if not the restaurant which is more of a sports bar.  Three of us had burgers and one the pulled-port sandwich and all agreed that their sandwiches were great and cooked properly.  These came with either a side salad or wedge fries.  I thought the fries mediocre, lacking the soft on the inside, crisp on the outside aspect of a good fry.

We all ordered draft beers.  Their menu listed 25 micro-brew beers on tap, and an additional 7 ""guest beers"" also on tap.

The waiter was friendly, efficient and attentive.  No complaints there.

All in all a good, but not great dining experience.  We did enjoy being able to sit outside.  We've sat inside in the past and it can get pretty noisy, especially if there is a sports game featuring a local team.  The beer was good, the food also was good but not great (what's with the fries?).  Perhaps next time we should explore the menu further.  

For a beer and a brew, this is a good option, but there are other items on the menu.  I should mention that there are vegetarian offerings.  I personally hate TVs blaring in the background which only add to the noise level inside.  A true pub wouldn't have the TVs, but that is our culture.

It really was outstanding and the tuna topping the roll was fresh and just melted in your mouth. 

The tempura shrimp lunch special was also really good. Everything was fried well with no oil and was very crispy. It came with a miso soup and a good helping of salad.

Having said that, I have been a regular patron of Sky Kitchen for many years & when it changed hands a few years back I fully anticipated there would be changes. It's expensive to operate any business but especially on the peninsula, what I didn't anticipate was to get gouging when ordering lunch. 

While my order may have been a little different (2 hamburger patties no buns, sliced tomatoes & a small gravy) I didn't anticipate being charged  $3 for two slices of tomatoes & $4 for the gravy.  My bad for not asking but I assumed (we all know what happens when you do that) that like the other sandwiches it came with the tomatoes, they would save on the buns & like other menu items a small gravy would be included but nope, $30 for lunch.

Few things annoy me more than getting nickel & dimed, especially when your a regular (that should not matter but when they know you well enough to have your preferred drink ready when you walk in, well they know you) but I will not be back. 

Again, given their level of business I am sure will I will not be missed but this business model is not sustainable & will eventually catch-up with the establishment.","Better Ask",31,"San Francisco, California",20jul2019,31jul2019

We were seated after a few minutes of waiting. They had to prep a table and we were just walk-ins. 
As we sat, I ordered the paella right away because it would take some additional time. (This was one of the items my mom saw online). 
We also ordered the dates with bacon, the yuca fries, the kobe sliders, the chicken tostados, and then the yuca fries again (my niece loved them).

Everything was so good. We were ready to order more but then our paella came out just in time. It looked so good... But then we busted into it and after a couple of excited bites, I kind of lost of interest. I looked over at my mom's plate and my aunt's plate and they both had token amounts sitting there but it was obvious we were saddened by our choice. The seafood did not have much flavor at all, the chicken was dry, and although the rice was hot and steaming, it really fell flat for us. For $50, it's a bit much just to be disappointed.

We had plenty of room for dessert then. We ordered the coconut cake/pie/tart thing with ducle de leche. We ordered the churros. We ordered the fried oreo cookies with mint ice cream.

We've been here several times over the last decade and knew that it wouldn't disappoint. The restaurant was already nearly full at 6:15 on a weeknight -probably some happy hour customers!

My husband chose the calamari appetizer which was served on a large rectangular plate and could easily feed two. He wasn't able to finish all of the ""Bianchi di spagna beans"" which were huge and delicious. You could easily consider this dish an entree if you're looking for a lighter meal. I chose the Burrata appetizer, but it seems they substituted another vegetable for the delicata squash. It had interesting textures, but the overall flavor was quite bland. My entree was the branzino (sea bass) which was served on a bed of fresh tomato sauce and black rice; it was fresh and satisfying. My husband chose the giant 16 oz. rib eye, which for some reason is printed in a very tiny font on the menu. It is the only beef dish, and perhaps was added out of necessity based on prior customer feedback. I thought it was rather tough, but my husband devoured it (he doesn't get much beef at home...)

We chose a nice sauvignon blanc from the fairly extensive menu of Italian wines. I found the wine list a bit difficult to navigate because all descriptions are in Italian. It would be nice if they grouped the wines by categories we're familiar with, such as chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, pinot noir, etc. 

We enjoyed the assortment of 4 small scoops of house made gelato for dessert - they're each creamy and delicious.

It is a multi-cuisine restaurant with bar and looked to well furnished when we entered inside. However, to our surprise they booked our party consisting of 8 persons in the back rooms of the restaurant, though we had asked for the front area. Although the food was good with fine service but being buffet all of us had to travel considerable distance through several tables on the way to pick up our items. In fact, the tables outside the restaurant on the pavements could have been better if the restaurant staff could have advised us during booking. They took the excuse of much booking because of Mother's Day falling next day. Regarding food there were several excellent vegetarian curries. This restaurant is known to be favorite for non-veg people. Of course, veg dishes are also very good and particularly the nan and biryani. The rest rooms were average, probably because of heavy rush. For eight of us, the total bill was 160 dollars including service charges. On the whole our experience was not that good and I advise people to check up about the seating area when they are booking in advance.

As he was hungry, my husband ate one in two seconds.  Then he took a close look at the second ""enchilada"" and proceeded to let us all know what he thought - and it was not pretty.  I dissected the ""enchilada"" before I went to the counter.  The taco was no larger than a street taco size, squashed as flat as could be.   There was the least amount of cheese possible inside and to make matters worse it was a partial cheese slice.   When I returned this to the staff and said ""I don't believe this is a cheese enchilada"" her reply was ""that is how we make them"".   Told her that cheese meant there should be a reasonable amount of cheese inside and did not back down!   Grudgingly I was offered a replacement.   This did at least have more cheese and the first.

1910920,0,1,"Incredibly overpriced, poor service, undesirable ambiance, and mediocre food are some of the things you can expect at Baumé.

I still can’t believe that this place is associated with Michelin. We’ve been to most of the one, two and three Michelin Star restaurants in San Francisco. We decided to make the drive to Palo Alto to try out Baumé, despite some of the negative reviews.

It was such a waste of a $1000. The meal wasn’t worth $398 per tasting menu. That’s more expensive than Manresa and Saison, both of which are 3 stars and will blow you away with the innovation and technique.

I was surprised when the waitress leaned in to take away the napkin rings as I assumed she was going to place our napkins on our lap as most fine dining restaurants do. At Baumé, you put your own napkins on your lap and don’t expect it to be folded nicely when you return from the restroom either.

The waitress is overly chatty to the point of being inappropriate and unprofessional. She mentions incidents from past dining experiences and laughs at her statements. She laughs a lot. One thing she doesn't speak a lot about is the food as she barely provides any explanation beyond a few words.

The ambience is cold and undesirable. It felt like I was sitting in a church storage room. It’s not the type of interior where you envision enjoying a high end meal and celebrating a special occasion. 

I have very little to say about the food. It wasn’t anything special. I’ve had much better meals in non-Michelin starred restaurants in SF.

Wine and the few cocktails that they offer are super expensive. For the firsf time at a fine dining restaurant celebrating a special event we choose not to drink. $45 for a saketini or $50 for a kir royal is extortionate. Furthermore there is no open kitchen or bar where you are able to watch the chef prepping this $398 tasting menu. Given the small amount of tables, you might expect to at least see the chef. However, he remains a mystery somewhere in back.","Overpriced and disappointing for the price ",8,"San Francisco, California",10may2019,28feb2019

2408860,6,3,"Regarding the GRILLED MARKET FISH on the menu: our daily fish, baby green beans, crimini mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, fingerling potatoes, tomato beurre blanc, tarragon oil

I ordered the grilled market fish, which the waiter said was Blue nose sea bass. My plate came with a beautiful mound of bright greens (my substitute for the nightshade family vegetables of potatoes and tomatoes on the menu), topped by two pieces of thin gray fish. As the plate was passed over to me, it had an unappetizing smell. Did not smell nor looked fresh to me.  Did not look like the white flesh and big flakes of sea bass I expected. I tested the smelly fish fillets with my fork and it easy separated into very small flakes.The texture was surely NOT ""sea bass"". It was some kind of flatfish - not fresh. I did not taste it. I sent it back to the kitchen. 

The replacement fish came and it looked like sea bass: thick, firm, creamy white in color with medium, mostly tender, flakes. No fishy smell. It was good! Was it the Blue Nose sea bass? I'm not sure. ""Sea bass"" is a generic term used for many different species of fish and most are not even Bass. The Blue Nose sea bass comes from New Zealand.

Later a gentleman came to apologize for the ""mistake in the kitchen"".  He offered something complimentary - a creme brulée,  My family appreciated the gesture. But….

The chef made the same mistake twice? My daughter’s fiancé had ordered the same grilled fish of the day and got the same two pieces of grey flat fish! But he bravely ate it. 

This review is merely to let others know to be aware of the kind of fish they are actually served. Apparently substitution is rampant, specially for sea bass or snapper - see  report by CNN on May, 2019; and also a UCLA study in 2017. If the substitution starts at the market, all the more reason for the chef to verify his fish! And for customers to know their fish.

2446815,0,4,"Pizza lovers working or living in or around Mtn. View are a lucky bunch. There are lots of styles/choices to be had for those looking to temporarily sate their addiction to crust, sauce & cheese. One great option is NP, which abuts Cost Plus World Market (to the north).

At first glance, prices might seem a little high if you’re a bargain pizza shopper, but you’d do well to keep a couple of things in mind. First, there aren't many other true Neapolitan style pizzerias on the peninsula or in the south bay; indeed, I know of none. And even if you’re willing to drive to SF, where there are several pizza-tossers laying claim to the moniker, very few seriously strive as does NP to mimic the pies you see in Naples. Second, both of the main SF Neapolitan contenders - Tony’s Pizzeria Napoletana & Una Pizza Napoletana - are more expensive than NP. Indeed, pies at Una start out at $20 and go up from there, while NP’s pies run $13-$17. 

In other words, if you really want this style of pizza south of SF, this is your place.

I’ve tried 2 salads to warm up for my main events. The INSALATA TRICOLORE CON PARMIGIANO ($10) combines arugula, Belgian endive & radicchio w/balsamic vinaigrette and shaved parmesan.  The INSALATA NOCI e GORGONZOLA accents a mixture of watercress, radicchio, Belgian endive & arugula w/gorgonzola, dried cranberries and apple cider vinaigrette. The salad ingredients were faultless, but for my tastes the dishes fall a little short. The dressing amounts were ideal, but neither had nearly enough acid to brighten their respective plates. Both salads were missing a deft had w/seasoning. And somebody got really carried away w/the dried cranberries. There were enough for 3 salads on my plate. A little more attention to detail would make these entries more fitting preliminaries.

But, of course, pizza is the name of the game here. I’ve sampled 3.

The NAPOLETANA PIZZA ($16) essentially is a Margherita pie (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil & extra virgin olive oil) w/a generous scattering of crumbled house-made Italian sausage.  Normally, I’m a diehard plainer-is-better guy w/this type of thing, but this pie *really* hit the spot. Fantastic balance, first bite to last.
	
The PROSCUITTO e FUNGHI PIZZA ($16) adds prosciutto & mushrooms to a Margherita base.  Very good pie, too, but I’d try the del Cafone (sausage, rapini, smoked mozzarella & extra virgin olive oil) next time, instead.

The MARINARA ($13), meanwhile, is a pie for true minimalists, boasting only tomato sauce, oregano, garlic & extra virgin olive oil. (I wasn’t expecting basil, but I got some anyway, which I’m sure is technical violation of some rule or other. It tasted good so I won’t file a complaint or anything :-)  Some people look at me like I’m crazy for ordering a pie w/out cheese, but when it’s good it reminds me of my great grandmother, who used to bake in a simple but effective outdoor oven. She didn’t make what most people think of as pizza, but one of the things I remember certainly was pizza-like; great crust topped only w/tomato sauce (or sliced tomatoes when the backyard garden was bursting w/them) & herbs. Simple can be great.

The thickness of the flavorful pizza frames has been uniform over my few visits & a smidge thicker than Tony’s. None of my pies were “too wet,” but you should gravitate toward the more sparsely topped pies if you’re concerned about that b/c trimmings like mushrooms contribute moisture. Toppings are high in quality & apt in quantity.

I tried dessert only once, in the form of a CANOLO ($7). The shell was quite nice, but the filling was too sweet & loose, and the copious amount of cinnamon sprinkled over the pastry totally overwhelmed the subtle treat, which is a no-no in my book.

Where Tony’s is trendy & packed given the owner’s fame and Una is often looked on by acolytes as a mecca worthy of a solemn sojourn from other continents, NP retains a casual feel even though it’s dead serious about bringing us an authentic taste of Naples.

Sounds good to me.

* Service is friendly, informed & generally timely, although I’ve purposefully dined during off hours.
* There’s plenty of free parking.
* NP’s list of wines by the glass is short, but the selections do the job.
* There are 6 pastas and a risotto, but I’ve been spellbound by the 9 listed pies. 
* I’d planned to discuss NP’s rare VPN certification and the ways in which NP’s authentic pies vary from other styles, but Local S. has admirably covered that ground.","Very Good Traditional VPN Pizzeria",7,"",21jun2019,31mar2019

The food was tasty and well prepared but the portion was inadequate. When  you are charging Palo Alto prices a dish that is chicken in a wine sauce should provide more than just a small  thigh piece. At a minimum two thigh pieces or even a leg plus a thigh would be minimally adequate.

Our omelets were fine, and we didnt have a long wait for our orders (well, the restaurant was less than half-full while the competitors were overflowing). But nobody ever offered to refill our coffee, and the omelets were served with a single pat of butter and a single serving of jam that both looked palry - just the wrong ""style"" for this sort of meal.

Portions are huge, so we shared the Salade au Foie de Volaille (warm chicken livers on spinach with pancetta and shallots and a nice dressing), which was yummy. The dressing perfectly balanced the richness of the liver and pancetta.

For main dishes, my son had the Civet de Lapin, which was a rich and savory braised rabbit on orzo. My husband had the Ribeye Steak aux Champignons, which was excellently tender and superbly flavorful. I had the Magret de Canard Sauce Dijon et Abricot which was a bit of heaven. Fluffy, rich mashed potatoes came with all of these, along with roasted vegetables for two of the dishes. We all had leftovers to carry home and thus room for dessert. My son had the Fondant au Chocolat (I didn't get a taste, because obbled it), my husband had the Creme Brulee (which he said was excellent and much better than others he has had recently), and I had the Tarte Tatin (the apples were delectable and almost caramelized).

Service started with bread and a delicious cold cream soup. The bread service is generous, and it came with a savory butter that my son found delightful. 

The staff is friendly, cheerful, knowledgeable, and not too formal.

People at two of the tables near us were speaking French fluently.

The wine list had good choices with something for everyone. They also make cocktails and have the largest list of their eponymous aperitif that I've ever encountered.

The ribs were overdone and had no flavor on their own. The sauce that lightly covered them and soaked the cold rice was salty. There were little nibbles of something indescribable that I think were browned shallots. I ate the ribs and couldn’t finish the rest of my $13 purchase and dumped the rest into the garbage. 

I saw that  they do a brisk take-out and catering business which is why I felt encouraged to give them a try.

The hostess was sitting in a chair that was not visible to a couple as they walked in. They waited for someone to greet them & had to step in closer and look around.

In terms of their pizzas, the sausage&honey one, the margherita, the rosemary potato&bacon are my three favorite ones. 

Have never had enough space for dessert but I bet they are really good!

The only issue is they only take a limited number of reservations so either go during the week for an early-ish dinner, show up early on a Friday/Saturday, or make a reservation far enough in advance.

This place is totally worth it and it’s best to go with a party of 6 or 8 so you can try a bunch of things.

Very nice atmosphere in the restaurant--even at 9:00pm, it was buzzing with people, both inside and outside.  We had a great table near the door, which allowed us to enjoy some of the outdoor breeze.  Despite the relatively loud atmosphere, we had no trouble hearing one another at the table.

The menu had a variety of small plates as well as pizzas.  We stuck to the small plates; they were delicious and we were both pleasant surprised by the portion size (larger than anticipated).  Flavors were clean and as-promised.  Beets were good; pistachios added nice texture and crunch.  Cauliflower was delicious; chilis added heat.  The grilled carrots were the best thing we had; grilling them brought out the sweetness, and a lemon yogurt added nice acid.

The parking lot is small, too small in my opinion. Fortunately, there was a man directing traffic in the parking lot and we were able to get into the lot without being rear ended by the traffic on Sunnyvale-Saratoga Road. 

It is not intuitively clear where you order food and where you pick up your food. We talked to several people about what they were eating and how to order. Once I ordered the cashier told me where to pick up my food. I ordered Shawarma On Hummus Plate with extra Falafel Balls and a bottle of water. Positive: possibly the best pita I have eaten. Negatives: everything else. Shawarma was bland. I asked for spicy but could not taste any spice. While I was in Israel, I felt that the local hummus was not as flavorful as the Greek version. I actually mistook the hummus on this plate for sour cream. Falafel Balls were flavorful but seemed smaller than I remembered from the beach vendor in Tel Aviv. 

Fortunately, there were only four of us. We ended up sharing a table with two young women. If there had been five or six, we would not have been able to sit together.

I had the Mediterranean Sea Bass served with pesto on a salad of spinach and other greens, roasted red peppers, tomatoes and olives. I was disappointed that the olives were simple California black olives, not Kalamata or other tastier ones. They didn't charge for a glass of wine to make up for the overdone lamb.

The restaurant is nicely decorated with high ceilings and decent spacing between tables. Parking can be a little difficult but doable. 

We came as a group of 4. We got healthy helpings of tortilla chips with their special sauce that was spicy and delicious. We started with 2 ceviche dishes. A Camaron that had did not skimp on shrimps and a pescado. Both had totally different taste profiles but were delicious with a sweat and tart flavors and a little kick. We also ordered several tapas, the Cochinita, Salmon and Pescado. They were just the right size and were flavorful and fresh.

For the main dish, I had the Mariscada, which had the overall appearance of a paella but not as wet. It was really good and I cleaned my plate. My wife got the cochinta Pibil which was yucatan style natural braised pork cooked with creamy plantain rice, homemade corn tortillas, queso fresco and several other items. I love pork so I helped my wife eat her dinner as well. Quantities were quite large and the overall food was fresh, well made, tasty and made a really nice dinner.

I should also mentioned that we order a sangria that had lots of fruit and healthy dose of alcohol which I think may have been brandy but it went very well with the dinner. We ended it all with their famous churros stuffed with bavarian cream & chocolate sauce, and a bread pudding that was moist but not too sweat.

Let me cut to the chase, the food was terrific, the service First Class and the atmosphere conducive for a great private birthday celebration.

We had reservations, and I'm glad we did, because there was a constant flow of patrons into this establishment the entire time we were there.  In fact, with the driving rain and strong winds, several of the patrons actually came inside the restaurant to stand in the walkway pending the availability of their table. Anytime you have all the seats taken in a restaurant and there are people waiting to be seated speaks volumes for the Chef and staff. 

After the opening round of drinks, the four of us chose in this order: Ceviche Trio, Guacamole and chips, pastelitos de cangrejo, calamari frito, a seafood taco trio, and for the one main dish tallarines con mariscos (try saying that three times in a row). Our server Lizet R was excellent; she knew exactly what we were doing and brought salad plates so we each could sample very delicacy that was brought to our table.  What a meal!!!!

Not a negative, just a fact the wooden benches are similar to picnic tables with NO back or vertical supports.  Hopefully that will not be an issue for you when you go there.

3786176,0,1,"We never got a chance to experience the food but only the extraordinary -- and truly jaw-dropping-- rude service of the hostess as described in recent Yelp reviews. As a side dish we received additional hostility from her male colleague. This is what happened :

Our daughter had recently undergone brain surgery for a tumor at nearby Stanford. Family was in town to visit her in the hospital; it was also my birthday. It was the first evening we felt comfortable leaving our daughter's side to eat a meal out. She was recovering well and we were all feeling relieved and happy. Our reservation was for 7:30 p.m. The restaurant is 10 minutes from the hospital. My daughter was settled and comfortable at 7:30, and we headed out at that time. As I was googling the restaurant to call and say we would be a few minutes late, the lady in question called me at 7:40 to ask if we were still coming. I said yes, we were minutes away, and apologized for the delay.

When we arrived we were ""greeted"" by both the lady and her male colleague. I gave our name. The male colleague replied with instant sarcasm. ""Oh, these are the people who are late."" The lady stared at me and said, ""I had to give your table away."" She pointed to a table by the door that was indeed full. Bear in mind I'd confirmed by text the day before -- and of course had only spoken to her moments ago. She said she would try ""work it out"" as she led us to a bar area.

When I asked why she had given our table away, especially as we'd just re-confirmed, she re-iterated that we were late. The man meanwhile was glowering at us. Growing agitated that now we might not be seated for a long time -- my 82-year-old mother was with us, still on East Coast time -- I said quietly, ""Look, we've just come from the hospital where my daughter has had brain surgery, it's my birthday, and we really just want to have a good evening."" She looked straight at me and said -- wait for it! -- ""Why is that my problem?"" I was so astonished by her hostility and complete lack of compassion that I turned to the surly man and repeated what I had just said. He rolled his eyes and said ""Long story."" And the woman again said, ""I don't know why you are making this my problem.""

At that moment my husband entered the restaurant (he had been parking the car across the street). He saw my distressed and stricken face. I told him I thought it was best we leave. The man said, ""Yes, go."" My husband asked what happened. I told him. By this point the nearby diners were all watching in horror (it's a tiny place). The woman and man continued to defend their appalling behavior as we walked out the door.

Afterwards we stood outside, absolutely gobsmacked, and wondering where we might find a table on a busy Saturday night at 8 p.m. But it didn't end there: The lady FOLLOWED US OUT and continued to harangue us. By this point I was near tears and trembling, and I asked her how could she be so heartless towards someone who she knew whose child was hospitalized after brain surgery. She came up real close to my face and said, ""Do you know how crazy you sound right now? You sound INSANE!!"" And then she laughed.

I turned away. My husband stepped toward her angrily. As if in a bid for sympathy from him, she said: ""Look I'm just trying to run a sh**y little restaurant here."" He assured that her she was succeeding, that her restaurant ranked as maybe the sh**iest restaurant ever, indeed a contender for the Guinness Book of World Records for sh**y restaurants. Now I see from other reviews that our treatment was not unique; just maybe the most extreme.

Thank goodness we discovered nearby Nobu could seat us at that moment. Of course there our party was warmly welcomed, the food and service were superb, and we managed to recover our hopeful spirits. I'd much prefer to post a positive review. So many people do so much good work in a difficult industry, it's a pleasure to recognize and praise them. But this is a case where a public service warning seems necessary.

The owners of Bistro Elan really should consider taking up prefabricated food preparation - perhaps on contract for an airline or something - anything where they can put their culinary skills to work without human contact.

The menu is quite European, and the wine list has a lot of very interesting French reds.
I had a duck leg, and it was perfectly cooked. Well, in American way - they always prefer to add garlic and strange vegetables instead of mash potatoes and a bit of sweat/dried fruits. But well - it was still cooked very well.
No espresso machine, but their french press coffee was still much better, than the usual filtered ""coffee"" served in US.

The generous amount of chicken mixed in the salad was tasty.  Overall, the salad was definitely a ten on a ten point scale.

The seating at the Barn is mostly outside, albeit with a small seating area inside the building.  I would guess that finding an inside table could be tough on a cold or rainy day; on a nicer day, sitting outside should be very comfortable.

4636730,3,5,"Mardini's is one of my favorite restaurants for three reasons: the food, the people,the prices. 

First off, if you go to Mardini's, you need to try the falafel. It is PERFECTED. It's so crispy, garlicky, and flavorful. I often get the deluxe veggie wrap (falafel, fried eggplant, and potatoes) and it is so good! I especially love the pickles in it and the spicy sauce. The food is always made fresh to order. It can be a little slow because of this, but it makes the food SO GOOD. There are a lot of good, Mediterranean veggie options, and they're vegan-friendly. 

The owners are kind and friendly. They'll sometimes give you extra falafel or samples of the food...especially if it's taking a while.

Mardini's is by far the best deal for falafel in the area. The servings are HUGE, and the prices are a really good value. For example, it's about $8.50 for a falafel wrap that can easily be two meals. I'll sometimes go to just get a garden burger and fries because the fries are so fresh and the whole meal is just $7.20. You can get pricier meals, but I never have. I imagine they'd be huge. 

Traffic can get a little crazy on Willow in the evenings, but it generally clears up by 7. Mardini's is such a good place to get really high quality food for a great price. The family-owned, no-frills environment is so refreshing when so much of Silicon Valley has such a, excessively hip, pretentious vibe. 

Date idea: get falafel wraps to-go on a Saturday afternoon, bring a blanket, and sit in the nearby park watching the adorable dogs play. You're welcome.","Mediterranean heaven...a Silicon Valley MUST for vegetarians and falafel enthusiasts",5,"Menlo Park, California",16jan2019,31jan2019

I was hoping to find a new favorite place nearby but after my experience last night, I will never go back to The Cask. 

My partner's entire wine flight was warm (not even room temperature, somehow warm) and tasted terrible. Two of the three wines in my flight were definitely not quality. I would have much preferred to receive three smaller glasses of quality wine than three larger glasses of what tasted like a cheap wine. Maybe it would be helpful if they put the wine ratings on the menu and give people the option to spend a little more money for quality wine. The waiter came over to our table exactly twice and no one ever asked if we had questions about the wine or created a space where we had an opportunity to ask questions before ordering.

The food was underwhelming to say the least. I ordered the flatbread and it tasted like what I imagine a subway flatbread pizza would taste like, except The Cask charged 3x the price ($14). I would have gladly paid $20-$25 for a higher quality flat bread. My partner ordered the lamb burger and was sorely disappointed. It just wasn't good and the sweet potato fries barely had any flavor, they were probably frozen. The waiter did not come over to ask us how the food/wine was A SINGLE TIME during the dinner. I saw several people delivering food, refilling water, offering cheese/pepper, and cleaning up tables, but they avoided eye contact and no one asked how we were doing. Finally we called the waiter over and told him the wine was no good. We clearly had not drank the wine and thankfully he took it off the bill without arguing with us, but he never apologized or asked how the food was. 

A manager or owner was prowling around the restaurant for most of the night, just hovering around seeming to want to keep an eye on things. Yet he never checked on our table, or actually made sure that the waiter was paying enough attention to us, or verified that the food/wine was good. As a matter of fact, our waiter spent a lot of time standing there talking with that guy instead of checking on our table. It was also slightly awkward to see the guy hovering around the restaurant like that.

4729483,0,5,"The first time I got at La Biscotteria I behaved like a kid in a candy store. Which is not too far from reality, after all!
The scent of bakery contributes to abate my will power... scent that I found again at home once I opened the biscotti bag. Ok, bags.
Just to clarify: we are talking here of what is called ""biscotti"" in U.S., that is a set of variation on a theme of cantucci cookies. And, despite TripAdvisor classification, this is a shop, not a restaurant: you buy (and often get some sampling), carry away and eat at your leisure.
So far, I have tried... Biscotti (8/10 $/pack, big pack is 16$): crunchy, flavourful, fragrant, genuinely dangerous for a bottomless cookie monster like me. In particular, I love the anice flavoured ones and the ones with hazelnuts. They sell also a larger pack with broken or end ones: they are usually not coated with chocolate -- after one is broken, they probably don't bother dipping it -- so there is less variety, but cheaper. And as good, of course, unless you have a penchant for the end of the biscotti, in which case it's actually better.
Focaccia with mixed vegetables (can't remember the price): dough was good, I was not very fond of the vegetables topping it, ""sott'olio"" style, which tends to flatten all the flavours.
Panettone (30$, I don't remember if it was 750 g or 1 kg): quite expensive, seriously good, moist, soft, flavourful. The one I picked is the most classic, with candy citrus and raisins.
Large cannoli (can't remember the price either): satisfying, excellent crunchiness and flavour from the dough, but I found the ricotta filling a bit too dry. For that reason, I preferred the cherry cannoli, where the cherry would partially compensate that dryness.
Sfogliatina (4$?): good, maybe a bit too spicey for my taste (but that's really me). Plus, this is pretty much the only place I have found it.
Struffoli (15$): great surprise: struffoli? in Redwood City, CA?!?. 15$ for a plate of them, which I stopped regretting paying as soon as I tried one. I did not eat many, either, because my partner also found she likes them. And they are addictive. These ones are quite crunchy, with moderate amount on honey, a few candy cherries, and small coloured sugar balls. Different from granma's (which was in turn different from grand aunt, saying that there are many styles), differently delicious. Did I mention addiction? Still trying to understand why I did not go back for more.

We took our spot and ordered the Tuscany, the Philly from the Savory list and chose Sunset from the Sweets. We also asked for a straw for our little one which seemingly was excessive based on the non-verbal signs... The savory crepes came with salad and French fries which was a nice touch, however the salad was drenched with some greasy/oily stuff, not exactly my liking. Still no sign of any smiles or any general kindness... I started to regret the tip I gave up front which their checkout system politely ""enforces"" when you prepay for your order. Going back to the food, the crepes seemed lukewarm, it felt they were sitting there for a while definitely not freshly made. The Philly was a surprise, the beef meshed well with the onions, mushrooms and the sauce. The Tuscany was a bit of a mixed bag, was bit too salty and my wife did not feel too great after eating it the rest of the evening.

food wise, so so: everybody comes for Crepe obviously. forget that savoury crepe are done with the same dough as sweet crepe instead of rye. When queueing next to the open kitchen one sees the pile of pre-cooked crepes. Not a fresh product. order instead the waffle: arrives lukewarm such that the chocolate chips don't even start melting.
service wise, so so: ask the whipped cream to be served separately but arrives on the waffle. Mistake. it is not critical, so we accept the dish... 5mn later another waffle with a side dish of whipped cream shows up and turn around. what takes a looon time to arrive is my sandwich. waffle is finished by the time it shows up.

At 1:30 pm, another table was occupied, and a couple more customers appeared by the time we were ready to leave.
The woman serving us was friendly.
We opted for a chicken (not fried) curry and a bento box, which came after a reasonable time.
The chicken (Japanese) curry included just that: chicken. No vegetables at all, with the exclusion of a little of pickled radish. The curry flavour was pleasant, and reminded me of the one I get from the Vermont Curry Sauce, which I do like. I believe the meat was actually chicken thighs, in bite size chunks, very moist and cooked to my taste (or, not overcooked). The rice was good enough too. I wish there were some vegetables in the curry, although the pickled radish did its job.
The bento box included some teriyaki beef and deep fried pork cutlet, plus three pieces of steamed vegetables (cauliflower, carrot and broccoli), and rice with seasoning. The beef was pan-sauted in bite-size slices, somehow on the thick side: it was fairly good although not thrilling. The pork cutlet was just excellent, moist and flavourful. Not much sauce to go with it, but we could have probably asked for more (we did not).
Hot tea was from tea bag, not bad (tasted like sencha) and less overpriced than usual at 1.5$ per cup (probably we could have had more hot water for a refill).

For the test, I feel like confirming the comments on the environment and vibes of the place.

My wife thought hers was tasty, and we both found the ingredients fresh.
But, the highlight was the care given by Andre, our waiter. The restaurant was cold, and he immediately offered to close the doors. We wondered if we could get a side of garlic bread, Which I don’t think was available, but he suggested he could get French bread, then a moment later came back and wondered if we’d like it toasted. He kept checking on us, each time wearing a generous warm smile.

According to the experts, coffee should be consumed within one week after roasting. However, the stuff in stores or the chains may be sitting on the shelves for a month or more. On average, the coffee will cost about $13.50 per pound, which is more than most chains, but it is worth it for the taste. There is also a little coffee shop to order fresh brewed espressos and the like. You also get a free coffee if you buy a pound or more. There are not a lot of places to sit, but it is very quaint. I could see spending an afternoon there if you wanted a change in scenery and a place to work. They close earlier (5:00 PM), so no late-nighters. Parking is a little tight, so it is best to go around to the back using the driveway south of the shop. I buy all of my coffee from there now to use on my Breville espresso maker.

Grew up in the area, so any new places to eat is exciting, especially since many restaurants leave the area as well. We have this establishment a try. It was decent although the music was a bit loud (about 10 diners at the time). The service was quick. The food was fine. Has a cup of tortilla soup, which was more chicken soup. Also had a tostada bowl (forgot the name), it was good. I liked the dressing although the chicken was a bit cold, due to the salad (maybe?), it was good. We even had the McChurro, which was yummy but a bit hot (burned my lip). Overall, good food but nothing to special. Not the best, but I’ve had worse. I doubt we’ll be regulars.

The service was very pleasant and fast.  They quickly brought me tortilla chips with a mild salsa verde, and I decided to get a margarita with my lunch, which was strong and tasty.

The food is consistently good and portions are good sized.  It’s Palo Alto so it’s not inexpensive and the atmosphere, being dark and moody, works better in the Winter than in the warmer months - although the enclosed patio is nice when it is warm

I have tried about all the appetizers and most are good.  The standout is the Pot Stickers.  Very tasty. For dinner my intention is seemingly always to try something different but somehow every time I end up with the Beef Chow Fun - medium spicy.  It’s very good.  Layers of flavor and most impressive is that the beef is always high quality - tender and generous portion of meat.  Noodles, sauce, beef and veggies seem to always be in the proper ratio.

Service is very attentive.  It seems pricy to me but it’s the “Palo Alto Tax” and I’d rather pay a bit more and have something that’s good to eat versa a little less money down the street for very average food.

First, the hostess was really surly. We were on the waitlist and I told her that we were in somewhat of a time crunch because we had a 6 Hour drive ahead of us. Instead of seating us as soon as our table was ready, she waited an extra 10 minutes. We thought she might be aggregating tables for a larger party, but no, she literally let four tables of two accumulate before she deigned to call us.  When I finally stepped forward to the hostess stand, in an effort to get her to call us, she looked straight at me and asked why I was there bc she hadn’t called me yet.

Once we were seated, service was quick. From the time we ordered to the time we left, it was 35 minutes.

As for the food, it was so-so. My husband ordered the Foo French toast, which was described as being soaked in egg. It clearly was not, which was readily apparent as soon as he cut through it. The inside was all white and very dry. The bread had barely been dipped in batter. Of the 4 half slices served, he left 3.5 slices on the plate. 

I ordered the Twice Baked Scramble. It was rather dry.  I thought the proportion of ingredients was off. I would’ve preferred more egg and scallions and a lot less potatoes. Also, I’m not sure what was “twice baked.”  Perhaps the potatoes?","Surly hostess, food so so",215,"Menlo Park, California",30jun2019,30jun2019

- I arrived at 4:50pm earlier than my 2 friends. The restaurant was mostly empty.  I expected to be seated, but was told I could not be seated until my full party (the other 2) arrived.  If the restaurant had been very busy, I could understand they don't want to just hold seats for who knows how long.  But that wasn't the case  - and I had to just stand by the door (as I wasn't interested in sitting at the bar) and wait. I felt very out of place, as there is no separate entrance way to wait - and so I was basically standing over a row of many empty tables, unable to be seated.
- When we were seated and ordering, I asked what the Saporito was, and was told it is rigatoni with tomato sauce.  When my dish arrived, it was spaghetti with tomato sauce.  Now, I know that's a nit.  Rigatoni - spaghetti - it's essentially the same.   But, considering an approx kid's size portion of spaghetti with marinara sauce (and nothing else) cost approx $18, I think it would hav e been better to receive a proper description.   I did tell the person who brought the food, who I think might have been a manager, that this was not the dish that was described to me.

Since I’m vegetarian and we had varying appetites, we chose three dishes to share from the middle column: the small potatoes, brussel sprouts, and grilled avocado. It was all sooo good. And perfect for three people.

9746767,4,5,"We came for an early dinner last Sunday. Our server walked us through the menu and offerings. He recommended popular and well-liked dishes. We started with the three fish appetizers, Hiram’s, kampachi, and steelhead, I think. Then they brought in the yeasted waffle. We were glad we doubled that order. It was excellent. One bite and you experience many sensations I. Your mouth complimenting each other. After that came the grilled avocado with ponzu sauce and a greenish brown paste packed with umami. That.Was.Sensational!
For the mains, we opted for the wagyu ribeye, the halibut, the fried chicken, with two sides, the Swiss Chard and the Brussels sprouts. I did not think I could get impressed with fried chicken but this was impressive. The wagyu was divine. The fish was moist and tender, with the seasoning just so.
We capped off the meal with three desserts: a light dacquoise, a black sesame dish with lavender ice cream, and a pecan tart. They also gave us a chocolate chip sandwich cookie dipped in ganache. 
Oh, did I mention their cocktails are so creative and delicious as were their beer and wine selection? I would recommend the Hunter Spritz, the Funky Dog, and the Monsoon Season.  Their French Rose was perfect for a warm day too.
The service was warm, friendly, but not patronizing or cloying. Our server was informative and managed to even do a light banter with us. The other staff completed a most pleasant evening, including the front desk staff, who bade us farewell when we were leaving.

We enjoyed every bit of the avocado, kampachi, salad, potatoes, chicken thighs, and trout. Delicately seasoned, the specific flavours of each item emerged. Surprising combinations, like green curry and smoked oysters in the chicken thighs, were pleasing. Ponzu and wasabi on grilled avocado was delightful.

Food made a mix impressions. Here is the run down with pictures attached 
- Brussel sprouts. Very nicely done served with mushrooms and over all excellent dish
- Guacamole with kale. That tasted good. 
- Kale salad with added protein - salmon. Salad was OK but needed a lighter dressing. Salmon was perfectly executed exactly as I ask it to be and was grilled to perfection.
- Pizza. My companion liked it very much 
- Salad with added protein - steak 
Now that was a complete disaster. Instead of steak you would normally expect to be served with the salad I got this beef stroganoff looking mess on the side, in little dish hot with some kind a weird sauce. This clearly cannot be put on the salad. 

Our server however recognized that this is not what I expected and took this item off The bill without us even asking. So again she did a wonderful job helping us

11727218,3,3,"Terrain Cafe inside Anthropologie in the Stanford Shopping Center is a restaurant serving both lunch and dinner.  The bread at the table was excellent and we enjoyed our entries, but the service, like unfortunately we have found at many Anthropologie locations across the US was spotty.  Our waiter was either new or “out of it,” as he was a mumbler (not quite a low talker) and seemed off key.  Case in point - the bread is supposed to be served in a planter, a Terrain signature feature and after the second serving we tracked down a waitress who said she would correct this. Our orders arrived without issue and were very good but again the waiter was very non-communicative.  It really is a shame because my wife loves the clothing and was looking forward to the meal but again service was not up to par.  I guess it comes down to the American economy - unemployment is low so you have to take what you can get.  Enough about that, if you go try the Steak Frites Plate, it was very good, as were several of the salads, but ask for a seasoned waiter/waitress!","Good food, Spotty service, Nice setting",239,"Victor, New York",15may2019,31mar2019

We asked for a sample of the wine. And waited. About 10 minutes later the sample arrived. We sipped. And waited. Finally another server -- apparently the one actually assigned to our table -- came by. Wine order. Check. Dinner order. Check. Our tasty beet salad arrived quickly. The bartender brought the wine. Our meal arrived. The farro and chicken bowl was very good; the steak frites was fine, though was delivered on what must have been a cold plate because the tender steak cooled down rapidly. All seemed well until we we finished our main courses. By this point the restaurant was nearly empty, and our server had literally disappeared. We waited. And waited. Eventually another server stopped by to ask if everything was ok. We asked what happened to our server. New, we were told. He apologized and took our dessert order, only to return a few minutes later to tell us both items we were interested in weren't available. We asked for the check and paid. On our way out, we asked the hostess what was going on. She said our server had left, and seemed surprised at the service lapses.

We normally are stuffed to the brim after a 500 dollar meal (with only one alcoholic beverage) as we should be, and we legitimately left hungry after our dinner at this Palo Alto location. Portions were a fraction of the size compared to every other omakase we’ve had and zero signature dishes were served. No miso black cod, rock shrimp, jalapeño yellowtail or any red meat. In hindsight if we had known we would have ordered individually but every other Nobu we’ve been to keeps that consistent with their signature omakase. 

Our meals at Nobu in other locations have been outstanding and something we look forward to everywhere we go and this was the most disappointing and underwhelming meal thus far.

This has been on my list of must-eat-restaurants for YEARS.  Sorry to say Nobu mystique didn't totally live up to the what I thought we would get.  We went with the Omakase menu about $200 each (8 courses). If you want less, go Tasting Menu for $150 and 5 courses.  Drinks were approx $16 each.  

Food: wonderful!  Sushi, sashimi and grilled lobster..like I haven't tasted except in Hawaii or Japan.  The presentation was simple and eat catching. They definitely have this down and know that people are expecting fresh and beautiful fish. 

Ambiance: expect very clean and Japanese.  Modern.  Some mentioned bland.  It's just very Japanese.  

I'll go back, but there are so many other places to try first.

Service: very good.  They bring water, take drink orders before even giving you a menu.  Interesting approach. All the staff was attentive and helpful. This may sound odd, but I wanted the staff to be a bit crisper in what they were wearing.  Each person is dressed in all black, fine, but I felt like clothes needed to be pressed.  I wanted French Laundry uniformity..in service and style.  
The Epiphany Hotel where Nobu is located is under renovation, so note that the restroom is on the 2nd floor not on first as was prior restaurant/hotel layout.  But very cool Japanese toilets..and heated too.

Online ordering: I always order my salad with the dressing and lime juice 
 mixed in. However, every time I pick up my salad, the dressing and lime juice are always separate and I have to mix them in myself. Only one time they were mixed in, and once there was no dressing at all.

12899487,0,5,"I was looking for a place to eat dinner with my family to celebrate belatedly my birthday and decided to go to downtown Los Altos.  Found Restaurant ASA and tried to make a reservation online, but was told there wasn't any availability -- it was a Saturday night.  So, I called and was told to hold, I was given the option of 5:45pm or 8:15pm, we took the later time.

We arrived a bit early, and had to wait a bit, but our table was ready at the reservation time.   This place was busy!  There were couples, larger groups and one table with children.  They also have a few sidewalk tables -- the group that arrived after us requested a table outside.

We decided to eat 'family' style selecting various items from the menu.  We didn't request any particular order or timing, so the dishes arrived at various times to the table.  In retrospect, we would have requested the dishes to arrive spaced out.

Our favorites were the paella (shrimp version), mushroom pasta, scallops, and the lamb two ways.

Paella -- it is an appetizer version, but the socarrat on the rice was a nice crunch, and the flavor wonderful -- the only downside was that there were only 2 shrimp with more than 2 people at the table.

Mushroom Pasta -- lots of flavor, good variety of mushrooms -- gone!

Scallops -- perfectly cooked, seared on the outside, tender on the inside.  They were served on arroz with corn on the side.

Liberty Duck 2 Ways -- confit leg and thigh was so tender, the breast was a generous portion too, not overcooked.  And with slightly spiced chard.

The service was very good, attentive, but not intrusive.  Water glasses were always filled.

We will be back with a larger group so we can try more of the menu!","Wow!  Can't Believe We Didn't Visit Earlier!",144,"Los Altos, California",22jul2019,31jul2019

The hamburger was actually quite good. Starting with the white bread bun, which was fresh and slightly sweet (perhaps brioche?), the cheese (described as ""government cheese"") was bland and didn't add much flavor, but the other fixings were fine. The meat was quite tasty, cooked to my specification, not over seasoned and firm.

The fries were delivered warm (I'd like them to be right from the fryer), unsalted as far as I could tell which is fine. The potato was bland and definitely needed something to dip in to add flavor. They also over tots and sweet potato fries which may be a better bet.

They were about 50% full at lunchtime, which suggests to me that they need to get more business to stay in business in expensive downtown Palo Alto. Perhaps they do better on weekends and evenings.

I'd go back again if in the area and hungry for a decent burger to give them another chance to impress me.

I liked my Lamb Biang Biang but didn't love trying to get around all of the fat on the lamb pieces (traditional Chinese style so my bad not theirs).  My husband REALLY loved his beef noodle soup.

Some tips I would give in coming first time. My favorite dish is ""Khinkali"". It is a very popular traditional Georgian dumpling made of twisted knobs of dough, stuffed with meat and spices. Just recently, they improved their recipe, now the layer of dough is thinner and the stuffing is flavorful and more juicy. The best way to start a true Georgian dinner is appetizer sampler so you can try authentic pkhali (vegetable and walnut spread), creamy walnut-stuffed eggplant rolls and house-made satsivi walnut sauce with chicken. I'm wine lover and they have great collection of Georgian wines. Unique Georgian Amber wine is also a must-try. Enjoy a glass of Rkatsiteli Orgo made with skin contact in clay jars called Qvevri and taste its rich flavor,notes of dry fruits and light tannins. Overall, I highly recommend this place.

There is no complimentary bread, I paid $3 for some slices of white bread, which was fairly good. I think this would have been a better experience if I had come with a larger group and each of us ordered one thing and then we all shared or if the restaurant served appetizer portion sized items for appetizer sized portion prices.

We had the sampler (beets pkhali, spinach pkhali, eggplant rolls, satsivi, shoti) as an appetizer, followed by the khachapuri adjaruli, mushroom khinkali, and a lamb and beef kabob. 

My favorite was the sampler, as everything on the platter was delicious.  The only disappointments were the khinkali (it was a little doughy for my tastes, but that's probably by design; it's not a flaw) and the puff pastry on our Napoleon dessert; it was soggy (to be fair, we have always found Napoleans in North America to be lacking; we're spoiled by our years in France, where the puff pastry in the mille feuilles can be sliced cleanly with a fork). All in all, it was an outstanding dinner, although we ordered too much and had leftovers.

I also wanted to order kebab, but they did not serve it with lavash bread ( to wrap) - there also must be onions ,parsley and sumac - all of them are available in Bay Area - so I did not try it

The restaurant is located on Castro street.  Traffic was heavy in the area and we missed a turn.  Luckily we found a public parking lot located behind the row of businesses containing the restaurant.  The lot was pretty full (this was a Sunday at around 5:30 p.m.).  

The restaurant was about 3/4 full when we arrived.  The layout is much deeper than it is wide, and we were seated in the back part of the dining area away from the street.  

Service was good. I never felt like we had to unduly wait for anything.  Menu options were more than sufficient.  I think I got a vegetable korma dish; I liked it.  We skipped any appetizers as we were flying out the next morning and didn't have any way to take along leftovers.  I managed to finish my entree, and that filled me up.

Our travels to Paris and other parts of Europe, are annually, and we frequent many Michelin Starred Restaurants, and many in the US and the Bay Area do not measure up to European standards.
But Protege certainly does, and could be equal to many US restaurant two starred restaurants.
It is by far the best restaurant in Palo Alto
hands down.
The very comfortable small dining room, beautiful photograph on the wall of redwoods and very casual atmosphere fits PA.
The service perfect and the 4 course tasting of John Dorey, and Lamb, and chocolate and everything in between was 
spectacular.
The textures, tastes, creative dishes were spectacular.
We will be regulars, hopefully we get get in...

13951034,10,5,"Protege is expensive (even for Palo Alto and even in their a la carte lounge where we ate) but worth it. 3 dishes stand out: the waygu beef (amazingly tender and flavorful), the shrimp toast that accompanies the lobster bisque (way and away the best tasting shrimp toast I've ever had), and the s'mores pie dessert (chocolately yes but the amazing part was that the marshmallow topping was perfectly toasted ... every bite brought back campfire memories!)

Our booth was comfortable and intimate (though it was a pity that the window to the kitchen - right next to us - was too high to actually watch the goings on). Portions are very small, although beautifully plated. The trout was delicious. Desserts were fine although the smore pie was too sweet.

Service however was not up to the food and decor. Our server did not make direct eye contact; it looked like he thought we were too old or boring to pay attention to. His manner was too casual, and he had that unfortunate habit of appearing as we had the first bites in our mouths to ask if everything was ok. In this price and food category, this should not happen. The host also showed a certain lack of interest in us, and we had to ask to have our coats taken. It was a cold and rainy night, should we have sat on our wet coats in the booth? Protege needs to pay more attention to training the wait staff.

We gave the sweet potato fries a try but I did not particularly appreciate it.

 If you are a hotel guest, be aware that their kitchen closes at 10 PM.   My husband and I walked into the bar area looking for a late night drink and meal, only to be informed that we would have to go upstairs and order from room service.   I pointed out that the restaurant could just as easily deliver to the bar as to our room upstairs. And the hotel room has no place to eat, except at a desk facing the wall, and only one chair. Fortunately, the restaurant manager was willing to accommodate us, but he made very clear that he was doing us a “special favor.”.  

 Of course, if this hotel were located downtown, we might have been able to walk out and go to another restaurant, but there is literally nothing in sight of this hotel property.","Food was fine but this restaurant closes early!",215,"Menlo Park, California",30jun2019,30jun2019

13982931,2,3,"Weekend Brunch with a family group.   

When you pull up you are hit with required valet parking (self-parking is on nearby streets and most of the street parking area is marked red for no parking).  Valet parking is steep ($35); the good news is three hours are validated when you eat at the restaurant so you can probably avoid the valet cost except of course for a tip to the valet.

Disappointed seating as we requested outdoor seating and upon arrival we were told since our group had more than four no outside seating was available (only can handle four at a table).  Tough to understand this argument when there were only about four groups in entire restaurant the entire time we were present and plenty of outdoor space.  Interior seating in a so called ""booth"" resulted in those who sat on bench seating sitting way higher than those who sunk  into chairs on opposite side of table.

Menu for brunch is ok-mostly breakfast items very few lunch items (basically, a hamburger).  Beverage menu is extensive.

Food is also ok-   relatively small portions, medium apparently means rare so if you want medium request medium well.

Service- leaves a lot to be desired and problem may be more with the kitchen than wait staff.  Though we ordered soon after arrival, food did not arrive for a long time; beverages were quicker.   Then after entrees, some ordered coffee and dessert.  Coffee arrived about ten minutes later and desserts about thirty minutes later.   All in all, brunch took three hours to complete ( one course plus dessert and coffee).   Fortunately, we were not in a rush.

Prices- For a group of five, with tax and tip for brunch the cost was nearly $250.

The facilities are quite nice and I think there is a lot of opportunity for this restaurant but much needs improvement.   The restaurant is in a hotel not very well seen from highway 101 as it is hidden by massive office buildings being developed around it.","Big potential, lacking on most elements",430,"Healdsburg, California",05may2019,31may2019

The chicken dish hit every single flavor profile from sweet to salty to savory. The shrimp was a bit on the sweet side but one of the most unique dishes I’ve tried. My only regret is that I could only order one entree. I will definitely have to come back and try the fish.

On an unrelated note, it was frustrating that the hotel did not validate my parking in exchange for eating at the restaurant. I live locally and was told by the valet that self parking was not an option, but valet was complimentary for three hours. However, I enjoyed myself so much that I sat in the bar and ordered a couple glasses of wine after dinner. I ended up being charged an additional $15. While $15 is not a lot of money, the restaurant menu is not necessarily inexpensive and I felt being charged for parking after paying $100+ per person for dinner left a sour taste at the end of an otherwise great experience.","Gorgeous Atmosphere and Phenomenal Dishes",1,"",17mar2019,31mar2019

14821272,3,5,"This review is actually for the Ramen Nagi in the Westfield Valley Fair Shopping Center in Santa Clara. I'm assuming the dishes at that location are the same as thIs location. 

I came her with my daughter on our way home from the San Jose Airport. We had originally wanted to go to Orenchi in Santa Clara for ramen but it was 1pm already and Orenchi was going to close at 1:30pm. So, we decided to give Ramen Nagi a try. Thank goodness we did. The ramen is soooooo flavorful as is the soft egg (which is extra). 

We both had the Original King which is a Tonkatsu-based soup. I defaulted to chef’s recommendation for how to configure my ramen except for the amount of salt and oil, which I opted for less (or “light” per the order form) and I got cabbage instead of green onions. I also ordered the “tamago” or “Japanese style egg”. Just like at Orenchi, the egg is soft and nicely seasoned.  So yummy!

Neither my daughter nor I can eat really spicy foods so we were worried about the default “Normal” spicy. It ended up being just fine with a little kick. I may order no spicy the next time just to see if the ramen is just as flavorful.

Although there was a line to get in, it went fairly quickly.  It helps that they give each person an order form ahead of time so that when you seated, you just hand it to the server.  It’s amazing how fast we were served our ramen.  This is a nice alternative to Orenchi because the wait time is less and the ramen is just as good, as is the seasoned egg.","Delicious Ramen at the Ramen Nagi in Westfield Valley Fair, Santa Clara",109,"Los Altos, California",12jun2019,30jun2019

14821272,5,5,"This is the second US restaurant of the Japan restaurant chain.  There is always a line (we came on a Saturday night and the wait was about an hour).  At least at Valley Fair, if there are multiple people in your party, others can shop in the mall while waiting.  While you are in line, they will provide an ordering sheet where you customize your ramen order.  We went with the standard king since this was our first visit.  The main tip is that the regular noodles are very thin, we went with the thick noodles.  While the wait line is long, once you are seated, service is very fast.  Seating is communal style, if you are in a large party (more than 4) plan on being seated separately.  

The ramen (more specifically the broth) is probably the best we've had (and we've been to top ramen restaurants in Hawaii as comparison), the ability to change the oil level is definitely something you typically won't have at other restaurants.  The standard salt level may be a bit much for some, I was expecting the normal salt level to be a bit flat, but it wasn't at all.  Your protein choice is limited to pork, so for those not wanting pork, you only option is no meat and/or egg.","This a review of Ramen Nagi 2 located in Westfield Valley Fair, Santa Clara",186,"San Jose, California",02jun2019,30jun2019
14821272,6,1,"Two of my friends and I ate here for the first time. The menu was explained to us carefully while we waited in line. We were then seated within ten minutes and served our ramen within fifteen minutes. 
As we were three people, we all ordered different customisations for our dishes. When it was time to pay, we asked if we could have the bill divided according to what we had ordered. The random server who had given us our bill told us we could split the bill when we paid at the front.
When we got to the front, we again asked if we could split the bill. A very sassy lady told us we could divide it equally. We then pointed to our receipt and showed her that we had all ordered completely different things. She told us the only way they could divide the bill was equally. Then she said we could divide it ourselves if we wanted to pay separately. We began adding up our amounts and she interrupted us snarkily and said « No you are forgetting the tax amount. » I asked her to then calculate the tax amount for our bills and she told us to do it ourselves. 
In the end, we split the bill evenly but this was the most frustrating encounter we have ever had dining out. It is shocking to me that a business in this age can’t handle a simple task such as dividing a bill. I would strongly recommend that management invest in better technology as it is unreasonable to expect patrons to split bills evenly when the menu is entirely customisable. Additionally, consider training your employees to check their attitudes at the door and approach problems with a can-do mentality. If I wanted to do it myself, I would have eaten at home.

As an adult, I prefer not having any of the toppings, but the kids loved the choices.  If I had to make one improvement, it would be to turn down the super loud music.

The two sandwiches we split was the Vietnamese sandwich which was not a i Mi but a chicken sausage in a French roll..Ok not great. The chicken breast was juicy and crispy as it was breaded and deep fried but a little oily. We had a choice of salad or fries with each sandwich so we got one of each. The garden salad was ok, and the fries was a generous helping but string fries are not my favorite as I prefer wedge cut fries. The lattes came in a large cup but there should have been a small biscotti or something to go with it. It may seem that I am being picky but it is these small things that make you want to come back again and again","Go quick before they shut down",443,"San Francisco, California",02feb2019,28feb2019

Water was served without having to ask.  The owner, Giovanni, graciously introduced himself, and gave us a brief description of the fare, which consists primarily of traditional southern Italian offerings derived from recipes of the Calabrian and Sicilian regions.  

The bread and pasta are made fresh on the premises.  Prices are not cheap, but quality is exceptional, and portions are quite generous.  

The wait staff was very attentive, and we never had to make an effort to get someone's attention whenever needed.  My wife and I split an appetizer and a salad.  For entrees, my wife had the rack of lamb, while i enjoyed the tenderloin, cooked to perfection in a rich, buttery mushroom sauce, served on a bed of grilled asparagus.   

When dessert was offered, I asked to split one of their fresh, homemade cannoli.  The owner wouldn't hear of it so he served me the cannoli, and generously served my wife a fruit tart on the house.  

Finally, the acoustics are conducive to a private dinner conversation.  I haven't been to a local Italian restaurant of this quality since San Francisco in the 1980s.","Best authentic Italian food on the SF South Bay Peninsula",30,"",06sep2019,31aug2019

We sampled four Italian wines (two unusual from family of one owner) and settled on two recommended by our waiter.  We had two perfectly balanced salads.  One with pear in the namesake salad and a roasted beet and goat cheese salad.  Walnuts balanced both salads and both homemade dressings were freshly made in house.  

We had two pasta dishes were exemplary examples of their homemade pasta!  Unusual sauces and ragu: one red with pork shoulder and house made sausage ragu over house made cavatelli, the other tagliatelle with a white bison ragu with cheese fondue and porcini mushrooms.

The raviolis were pleasantly different from the usual American-Italian fare; they had a nutty coating, actually tasted like squash, and weren't innundated in butter. The tagliatelle was a little overcooked, but wonderfully tasty nevertheless. It's a small comfortable place. Service was prompt. The bread was warm and the water was very cold.

15553826,9,1,"Sadly, this was the worst experience we've ever had in Los Altos.  We were excited to try Tre Monte, a new restaurant in our little town.  When we walked in without a reservation at 5:30 pm, the three guys at the host(ess) desk would not make eye contact for a significant amount of time... not even ""I'll be with you in a moment"".  Finally, after asking if we have a reservation, he surveyed the mostly empty room and offered the worst table in the house... right between the hostess podium and the front door.  It was cold outside, so we requested one of the empty tables near the front window.  ""Oh no, those are reserved... but we will close the front door so you are not cold"" he said.  Fifteen minutes later, new guests arrived... without a reservation (we could hear the conversation since we were inches from the door and the desk).  They were happily seated at one of the front window tables.  No other guests ever arrived to take those tables.  In the meantime, one of the owners continuously went in/out of the front door creating a cold breeze every time. He stood on the sidewalk... looked up and down the street... then returned.  

When my husband pointed out the issue(s), the waiter who sat us said it was not his decision, but it was the owner's.   We were flabbergasted.  No apology nor an offer of even a cup of coffee for our discomfort.  We have lived in Los Altos for 8 years, raised children here and my husband's office is on Main street.  We do not look like homeless people, nor do we look like teenagers with poor tipping habits. I am dumbfounded to understand why we were treated in this way.

It's a pretty simple spot where you can eat in or order to go. There aren't that many seats inside (maybe 12 or so tables) but there's also seating outside on the patio. Seems to be a popular spot where the lunch rush may create a long line and possibly a long wait. I was there just before the rush and waited less than 5 minutes for my order. Ordering is very ""Silicon Valley."" What I mean is you order via a computer kiosk.

Once your order is ready they call out your name and you just walk up and pick up. The food? Shakes were great. I had vanilla, my wife went with strawberry. The fries were crinkle-cut and served fresh to order. The burgers were juicy with the beef cooked medium (you can order well done if you prefer). The star of the meal - to me - was the bun. It was fresh soft and very tasty.

There's a chicken sandwich and other menu option too. I'll be coming back to try the chicken. If it's as good as the burger, I'm a fan for good!","Burger, Fries, and a Shake",19,"Tracy, California",28may2019,31may2019

15617795,3,2,"This restaurant replaced Wells Fargo Bank.  We had to check out this place to see why the lines and wait times were often long.  Not impressed, and here are the reasons:

1.  You don't order at the counter.  Your order is done by entering it on a computer screen.  Five units were there, but only three operational. Two were broken.
2. The GUI is in need of improvement in at least four ways, such as not easy to navigate, the items selected are not summarized on the screen, etc.  Frustration was evident, despite an employee being there to assist.  Someone said they are working on a better interface.
3.  The eating area is noisy, and has no soundproofing.
4.  To make #3 worse, there's muffled, unintelligible ""music"" coming from the ceiling. It had mostly bass, no midrange, no treble.
5.  The tables in the waiting area were one can sit and eat are a bit high.  The bar stool chairs have bars on only two sides,
6.  The french fries were disappointing, no where near the quality of In & Out or McDonalds.  The fries were not hot, and they had very little flavor.  The good part:  they were not salted.
7.  Although the malt milkshake was outstanding, clumps of malt powder were throughout the shake.
8.  The double hamburger was definitely above average, but the onions, pickles, etc. were sparse and not evenly distributed.  Very lopsided.  There was only two round pickle slices on our burgers.
9.  We ordered ""Shake Shack Sauce""  on the side, but it was no where to be found.
10.  The ""cherry peppers"" ----  oh my!   The peppers were unusually ""hot"" and without warning anywhere.  We had to remove them from the burgers. Other restaurants have a caution when a food is very spicy/hot.  
11.  The milk shake was $6 and high-priced for the size.

The pick-up counter was so busy, we didn't seek to rectify any of the above. It was $30 for two hamburgers, one shake, and one fries.

15617795,4,4,"The appearance of a Shake Shack in the Bay Area was met with the same long lines of customers as when Krispy Kreme and In-and-Out Burger made their debuts here a decade ago. The location is a good one, located at the Stanford Mall, but not in the main mall building itself. 

Lines are out the door at many times of the day and indoor dining space can be hard to come by, especially if you bring a large group. If that's your plan, wait for nice weather and think about an outdoor table.

Ordering is done via iPads located just inside the door with an interface that could be more utilitarian than cutesy in my view, and payment by credit or debit card. Not sure what cash customers do, but there has to be a way.

Their signature burgers, fries, and shakes are quite good, a clear step above fast food outlets without the sting of the price you'd expect at a pub or upscale restaurant. 

The atmosphere is loud. Completely open space with Ikea-like furnishings and hip background music that really adds little except extra decibels to the experience. You go for the people you're with and decent food, not the ambiance.

Parking is easy since there's a huge lot associated with the mall. If you plan to do some shopping before or after, it's easy to walk to Shake Shack but be careful as parking lot drivers are easily distracted.","Lots of Buzz; Decent Meal",29,"Menlo Park, California",29mar2019,31mar2019

Yes, sure, after a few trips to this place i'm sure the use of the touch screen ordering pad will become more easier to use, but for first timers I can be a bit cumbersome placing what you hope is a correct order.

After properly placing our order, I went up to the counter to pick up my food only to discover that my order was completely wrong! I did not receive the particular burger that I ordered and my wife's chicken sandwich order was wrong as well.  The nice employee behind the counter did fix it promptly and even said to just keep the incorrect food items if we wished. That showed me a good move as far as their customer service was concerned. As far as the quality and quantity of the burger, chicken sandwich and fries...Just ok! The burger wasn't as big as it should have been given the price and the same goes for the sandwich.

Have to say that we were blown away at the quality of the fresh, handmade Udon noodles and pleasantly surprised by the diversity of Izakaya/Small Plate offerings that they had which were all very tasty. Definitely give the Truffle Udon and Tori Paitan Udon a try - we enjoyed both very much.

We purchased the pre-paid dinner thru Tock a month back. They do only one seating in the night and it lasted over three hours. The dinner time was 7PM and they served us multiple hors d'oeuvres until 7:30PM while we stand against the sideboards and enjoyed drinks that we ordered. At 7:30, they seat you across along with all the other guests at this long communal table. We were four of us and spent a good time chatting with another couple sitting next to us.

Each dish was perfectly timed and presented by one of the chefs along with the wine pairing we purchased separately by the Sommelier Jose, who did an excellent selection. They have a choice of 3oz or 2oz pours for the pairing - one for each course. The price of the wine pairing was very reasonable.

They even have a martini cart. Next time I go I'm going for the cocktails. They have an extensive wine list. I was told they have 3,000 bottles in their wine cellar.

I ordered the burger because I wanted to compare it to their sister restaurants, The Village Pub and The Village Bakery. The Village Pub burger has always been my favorite in the area. I now have a new favorite. The Selby burger is the best. It's very different from the other burgers. I was told they use a special blend of beef including wagyu beef. (My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it.) They serve it with a yummy aioli sauce. It comes with french fries that are excellent. They have a Black Label burger which costs $50 and has a secret blend of meat with shaved black truffles. I did not get that burger. The burger I'm talking about is just the regular burger.

My dining companion ordered the petite filet mignon. It was an excellent cut of beef. We shared a wedge salad, which was a little dry. They offered us an unique amuse-bouche - Gruyère popovers. We were very amused. Delicious! For dessert we ordered ice cream, which is homemade, and tastes like it.
