# Python for Stanford Economics PhD students

This is a repo for Stanford Economics students who want to use Python during the first year PhD sequence. 

### Why Python? 
1. **Popular**: one of the most used programming langugages in the world. 
2. **Community**: the python community provides lots resources to make python better: open source packages; and forums with plenty of questions and answers; and videos and tutorials  to use packages.  
3. **Free and open source:** You can always look under the hood to see what packages doing. Anyone can run your code without paying for software like Matlab or Stata, and Jupyter notebooks make it easy to share your code and results together. 
4. **General purpose**: Modern economic research involves lots of tasks, many of which can be done in python: computing and estimating models (numpy, scipy, numba), data analysis (pandas), doing algebra (sympy), mapping (geopandas), machine learning (keras, tensorflow, pytorch), webscraping (beautiful soup), text analysis (nlkt), digitizing records (layout-parser), creating websites (Jupyter plus GitHubPages), parallel programming on the GPU (cupy, numba).

### What we do
In this repo we provide resources to learn python and get ready for the first year sequence. We'll let you know when we add more material.
1. Getting set up with Python [[link]](GettingSetUp.md)
2. Starting to program with Python [[Notebook]](OurFirstNotebook.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/higginsbrian/Stanford-Econ-Python-Public/blob/main/OurFirstNotebook.ipynb)
3. Precamp problem set a (fibonacci) [[Notebook]](precamp_pset_a.ipynb) [[Data]](Trip_Advisor.xlsx) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/higginsbrian/Stanford-Econ-Python-Public/blob/main/precamp_pset_a.ipynb)
4. Precamp problem set b (data) [[Notebook]](precamp_pset_b.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/higginsbrian/Stanford-Econ-Python-Public/blob/main/precamp_pset_b.ipynb)
5. Precamp problem set c (pareto) [[Notebook]](precamp_pset_c.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/higginsbrian/Stanford-Econ-Python-Public/blob/main/precamp_pset_c.ipynb)

**Note:** You can open the notebooks in Google Colab if you are logged into a google account. Though since you have already installed Python you can download and open the problem sets.


### More resources
Here are some resources we found useful
1. [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/). A website with many examples of models solved with Python (and Julia too!).
2. Cheetsheet by Quantecon for [Python](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/python-cheatsheet.html); [Python vs Matlab vs Julia](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/); [Stats: Python pandas vs Stata vs R](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/stats-cheatsheet.html).
3. [Introduction to Scientific Computing with Python (CME 193)](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cme193/syllabus.html). A one-unit course at Stanford -- worth taking at some point to see the full capacity of Python.  
4. [Toward Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/). Short articles on all things Python. Want to know how to use some of the packages listed above? There is bound to be an intro here. 
5. [Stata to Python Cheatsheet](http://www.danielmsullivan.com/pages/tutorial_stata_to_python.html)
